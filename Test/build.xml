     ANT TEST FILE FOR THE TEI STYLESHEETS.
        
     MDH 2017-01-01: This is an EXPERIMENTAL build file which is 
     attempting to wholly replace the Makefile in the Stylesheets/Test
     directory. I want to discover:
    
     a) How easy it is to replicate all the functions of the Makefile in ant.
     
     b) Whether this is faster or slower than running the Makefile. I hope to
        discover that it's faster, because we only instantiate one VM to run 
        ant, rather than running Saxon multiple times. Doing all the file diffs
        takes, for instance, only 1 second for me.
        
     c) How practical it will be to make this cross-platform (i.e. to support 
        Windows).
        
     Work on this file is proceeding in small steps...
     
     Issues with the Makefile process:
     
      - It's difficult to understand.
      
      - It's multilayered: for instance, a call to:
            test.rng
        calls the symlink teitorelaxng, which calls the script transformtei, 
        which calls ant passing a build-to or build-from file, which calls 
        Saxon....

     Note: passing the full path to p5subset.xml, including the file name,
     appears to work, but passing only the directory fails. This is contrary
     to current Stylesheets documentation.
