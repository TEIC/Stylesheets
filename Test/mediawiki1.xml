==History==
The project to create the BNC involved the collaboration of three publishers (with the [[Oxford University Press]] as the lead collaborator, [[Longman]] and [[W. &amp; R. Chambers]]), two universities (the [[University of Oxford]] and [[Lancaster University]]) and the [[British Library]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LeechGarsideBryant1994&quot;/&gt;

The creation of the BNC started in 1991 under the management of the BNC consortium and the project was finished by 1994. There have been no additions of new samples after 1994 but the BNC underwent slight revisions before the release of the second edition BNC World (2001) and the third edition BNC XML Edition (2007).&lt;ref name=&quot;natcorp&quot;&gt;[http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/corpus/index.xml ''What is the BNC?'']. Retrieved 12 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
The BNC was the vision of computer linguists whose goal was a corpus (collection of texts) of modern (at the time of building the corpus), naturally occurring [[language]] in the form of [[speech]] and text or [[writing]] that could be analyzed by a computer. Hence, it was compiled as a general corpus to be made readable by computers to pave the way for automatic search and processing in the field of [[corpus linguistics]]. One of the ways BNC was to be differentiated from existing corpora at that time was to open up the data not just for the use of academic research, but to commercial and educational uses as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;geoffreyleech1993&quot; /&gt;

The corpus was restricted to just [[British English]] and was not extended to cover [[World Englishes]], partly because a significant portion of the cost of the project was being funded by the British government which was logically interested in supporting documentation of its own [[linguistic variety]].&lt;ref name=&quot;geoffreyleech1993&quot; /&gt;

Because of its potentially unprecedented size, the BNC required funds from the commercial and academic institutions as well. In turn, BNC [[data]] then became available for commercial and academic research.&lt;ref name=&quot;geoffreyleech1993&quot; /&gt;

==Description==
The BNC is a [[monolingual]] corpus as it records samples of [[language]] use in [[British English]] only, although occasionally words and phrases from other [[languages]] may also be present. It is a synchronic corpus as only [[language]] use from the late 20th century is represented; the BNC is not meant to be a historical record of the development of [[British English]] over the ages.&lt;ref name=&quot;natcorp&quot;/&gt; From the beginning, those involved in the gathering of written data sought to make the BNC a balanced corpus and hence looked for data in various mediums.&lt;ref name=&quot;geoffreyleech1993&quot; /&gt;

===Components and content===

====Written corpus====
90% of the BNC is samples of [[written language]] use. These samples were extracted from regional and national newspapers, published research journals or periodicals from various academic fields, both fiction and non-fiction books, both published and unpublished material such as leaflets, brochures, letters, essays written by students of differing academic levels, speeches, scripts and many other types of texts.&lt;ref name=&quot;gloriacappelli&quot;&gt;[http://www.gloriacappelli.it/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/bnc.pdf ''British National Corpus'']. Retrieved 12 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spoken corpus====
The remaining 10% of the BNC is samples of [[spoken language]] use. These are presented and recorded in the form of orthographic transcriptions. The spoken corpus consists of two parts: one part is [[demographic]], containing the transcriptions of spontaneous natural [[conversation]]s produced by volunteers of various age groups, social classes and originating from different regions. These conversations were produced in different situations, including formal business or government meetings to conversations on radio shows and phone-ins.&lt;ref name=&quot;gloriacappelli&quot;/&gt; These were to account for both the [[demographic]] distribution of spoken [[language]] and those of linguistically significant variation due to context.&lt;ref name=Burnard /&gt;

The other part involves context-governed samples such as transcriptions of [[recording]]s made at specific types of meeting and event. All the original recordings transcribed for inclusion in the BNC have been deposited at the [[British Library Sound Archive]].

===Sub-corpora===
Two sub-corpora (subsets of the BNC data) have been released: BNC Baby and BNC Sampler. Both these sub-corpora may be ordered online via the BNC webpage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BNC Products|url=http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/corpus/index.xml?ID=products|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BNC Baby is a sub-corpora of BNC that consists of four sets of samples, each containing one million words tagged as they are in BNC itself. The words in each sample set correspond to a specific [[genre]] label. One sample set contains spoken conversation and the other three sample sets contain written text; [[academic writing]], [[fiction]] and [[newspapers]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burnard|first=Lou|year=2003|title=Reference Guide for BNC-baby|url=http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/archive/oldBabyDocs/index.html|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest third edition has been released and comes in the XML format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New edition of BNC Baby available|url=http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/news.xml?ID=baby2|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BNC Sampler is a two-part sub-corpora, a part each for written and spoken data. Each part contains one million words. The BNC Sampler was originally used in a project to work out how to improve the tagging process for the BNC, eventually leading to the BNC World edition. Throughout the project, the BNC Sampler was improved with the gain in expertise and knowledge for tagging to make it what it is today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BNC Sampler: XML edition|year=2008|url=http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/corpus/sampler/sampler.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tagging===
The BNC corpus has been tagged for grammatical information ([[part of speech]]). The tagging system named CLAWS went through improvements to yield the latest CLAWS4 system which is used for tagging the BNC. CLAWS1 was based on a [[Hidden Markov Model]] (HMM) and when employed in automatic tagging, managed to successfully tag 96% to 97% of each text analyzed. CLAWS1 was upgraded to CLAWS2 by the removal of the need for manual text processing before the texts could be ready for automatic tagging. The latest version CLAWS4 included improvements such as more powerful [[word-sense disambiguation]] (WSD) abilities, as well as being able to deal with varieties in [[orthography]] and [[markup language]]. Later work on the tagging system looked at increasing the success rates in tagging text automatically and reducing the work needed for manual processing while still maintaining effectiveness and efficiency by introducing software to do some of the manual work.&lt;ref name=LeechGarsideBryant1994 /&gt;&lt;ref name=2leechgarsidebryant1994&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leech|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Garside|first2=Roger|last3=Bryant|first3=Michael|year=1994|title=Claws4: The Tagging Of The British National Corpus|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/versions;jsessionid=75B37141A35CA4F8D290BE74B0CB4D5E?doi=10.1.1.13.3622|publisher=Paper given at COLING'94, Lancaster: UK|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a new program called the Template Tagger was introduced for a corrective function. Tags indicating ambiguity were later added. Manual tagging still has to be done as CLAWS4 is still unable to deal with foreign words.&lt;ref name=&quot;leechsmith2000&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leech|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Smith|first2=Nicholas|year=2000|title=The British National Corpus (Version 2) with Improved Word-class Tagging|url=http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/bnc2/bnc2postag_manual.htm|publisher=UCREL, Lancaster University, UK|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2leechsmith2000&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leech|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Smith|first2=Nicholas|year=2000|title=Automatic POS-Tagging of the Corpus|url=http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/bnc2/bnc2postag_manual.htm|publisher=UCREL, Lancaster University, UK|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical information===
The corpus is marked up following the recommendations of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] and includes full linguistic [[annotation]] and contextual information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burnard|first=Lou|year=1995|title=Users Reference Guide for the British National Corpus|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~csc264/teaching/NLP/practicals/bnc-doc.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access===
The licence for the CLAWS4 tagger for part of speech information may be purchased to use the tagger.&lt;ref name=&quot;purchase&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Obtaining a license for the CLAWS tagger|url=http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/claws/purchase.html|publisher=UCREL, Lancaster University, UK|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, a tagging service is offered at [[Lancaster University]].&lt;ref name=service&gt;{{cite web|title=The CLAWS tagging service|url=http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/claws/tagservice.html|publisher=UCREL, Lancaster University, UK|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BNC itself may be ordered with either a personal or institutional license. The edition available is the BNC [[XML]] edition and it comes with the [[Xaira]] search engine software. Ordering may be carried out via the BNC website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to order|url=http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/getting/index.xml?ID=order|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An online program, BNCweb, has been developed for the BNC XML edition. The interface is designed to be easy to use and the program offers query features and functions for corpus analysis. Results and data from searches and analyses may be retrieved by users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoffmann|first1=Sebastian|last2=Evert|first2=Stefan|year=2008|title=Corpus linguistics with BNCweb: a practical guide|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-3-631-56315-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Permission issue==
The BNC was the first [[text corpus]] of its size to be made widely available. This could be attributed to the standard forms of agreement, between rights owners and the Consortium on the one hand, and between corpus users and the Consortium on the other. [[Intellectual property rights]] (IPR) owners were sought for their agreement to incorporate their materials in the corpus without any fees and shown the standard licence agreement which is relevant up till today. The acknowledgement with this arrangement may have been influenced by the originality of the concept and the prominence associated to this big idea.&lt;ref name=Burnard&gt;{{cite web|last=Burnard|first=Lou|year=2002|title=Where did we go wrong? A retrospective look at the British National Corpus|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~lou/wip/silfitalk.pdf|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there was the problem of keeping the identity of contributors hidden without discrediting the value of their work. Any distinct allusion to the identity of contributors was largely taken down and the alternative of substituting it with a different name had been discussed. Yet this solution of using substitution was seen as being not feasible.&lt;ref name=Burnard /&gt;

Adding on to the earlier problem was the fact that the contributors had earlier been asked only to incorporate transcribed versions of their [[speech]] and not the [[speech]] itself. While permission could be sought from initial contributors again, the lack of success in the anonymization process meant that it would be challenging to sought materials from initial contributors again. At the same time, two factors compounded the unwillingness of IPR owners to donate their materials. Firstly, full texts were to be excluded and secondly, there was no motivation for them to disseminate information using the corpus, particularly since the corpus operates on a non-commercial basis.&lt;ref name=Burnard /&gt;

==Problems and limitations==

===Overly broad categories===
By 2001, the BNC still had no text categorisation for written texts beyond that of domain and no categorisation for spoken texts except by context and [[demographic]] or [[socio-economic]] classes. For example, a wide variety of imaginative texts ([[novels]], [[short stories]], [[poems]], and drama scripts) were included in the BNC but such inclusions were deemed useless as researchers were unable to easily retrieve the [[sub-genres]] on which they wanted to work (e.g., [[poetry]]) because this information was omitted in the file headers or in any documentation associated with the BNC. Hence there was no way to know whether an &quot;imaginative&quot; text actually came from a [[novel]], a [[short story]], a drama script or a collection of [[poems]] (unless the title actually reflexively includes the words &quot;a [[novel]]&quot; or &quot;[[poem]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=Lee2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=David|year=2001|title=GENRES, REGISTERS, TEXT TYPES, DOMAINS, AND STYLES|url=http://llt.msu.edu/vol5num3/pdf/lee.pdf|pages=37–72|volume=5|issue=3|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later with the introduction of a new version in 2002, the BNC World Edition, BNC attempted to deal with this problem of overly broad categories. Besides domain, there are now 70 categories for [[genre]] for both spoken and written [[data]]. Hence, researchers are now able to specifically retrieve texts like [[poetry]] and [[prose]].&lt;ref name=davidlee2002&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=David|year=2002|title=NOTES TO ACCOMPANY THE BNC WORLD EDITION (BIBLIOGRAPHICAL) INDEX|url=http://pezik.pl/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/BNCWIndexNotes.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after these additions however, implementation is still tricky as assigning a [[genre]] or [[sub-genre]] to a text is not straightforward. The divisions are less clear for spoken [[data]] than they are for written [[data]] as there was more variation in topic and execution. Also, there will always be possible subsets of each [[sub-genre]]. The extent of the dividing of [[genres]] are pre-determined for the sake of a default but researchers are allowed the option of making the divisions more general or specific according to their needs. Categorisation is also a problem as certain texts, while deemed to belong to an interdisciplinary [[genre]] such as [[linguistics]], include content that is subsequently categorised into either [[arts]] or [[science]] categories due to the nature of their content. Users are cautioned to be aware of such possibilities.&lt;ref name=davidlee2002 /&gt;

===Classification errors and misleading titles===
Some texts were classified under the wrong category, usually because of a misleading title. Users cannot always rely on the titles of
the files as indications of their real content: For example, many texts with &quot;lecture&quot; in their title are actually classroom discussions or tutorial seminars involving a very small group of people, or were popular lectures (addressed to a general audience rather than to students at an institution of higher learning).&lt;ref name=Lee2001 /&gt; One reason is that [[genre]] and [[sub-genre]] labels can only be assigned for the majority of the texts in a category. There are [[sub-genres]] within [[genres]] and for each text the content may not be uniform throughout and may span across [[sub-genres]].&lt;ref name=davidlee2002 /&gt; Also, production pressures coupled with yet insufficient information at that time led to hasty decisions, resulting in inaccuracy and inconsistency in records.&lt;ref name=Burnard /&gt;

===Spoken discourse under-represented===

The proportion of written to spoken material in the BNC is 10:1.&lt;ref name=Burnard /&gt;  This is because the cost of collecting and transcribing in electronic form one million words of naturally occurring speech is at least 10 times higher than the cost of adding another million words of newspaper text. Most people would argue that since speech and writing are both equally important in a language, then both should be equally represented in the corpus.&lt;ref name=Burnard /&gt;

The BNC is not ideal for the study of many features of spoken discourse since most of its transcripts are orthographic. Paralinguistic features are only roughly indicated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aston BNC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Aston|first=Guy,|year=1998|title=Learning English with the British National Corpus|url=http://www.sslmit.unibo.it/~guy/barc.htm|publisher=Paper given at 6th Jornada de Corpus, Barcelona: UPF|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Useful only in studying grammatical patterns which have distinctive lexical correlates===
Despite being an excellent source of [[lexicon|lexical]] information, the BNC can only really be used to study a limited set of grammatical patterns, particularly those which have distinctive [[lexicon|lexical]]  correlates. While it is easy enough to find all the occurrences of &quot;enjoy&quot;, and to sort them according to the [[Part of speech|part-of-speech]] category of the following word, it is impossible to find all cases of verbs followed by a [[gerund]], since the SARA index does not include [[Part of speech|part-of-speech]] categories such as &quot;all verbs&quot; or &quot;all V-ing forms&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aston BNC&quot; /&gt;

Some [[lexicon|lexical]] correlates are also too ambiguous to allow them to be used in queries: any search for restrictive [[English relative clauses|relative clauses]] would provide the user with irrelevant data, given the number of other uses of wh- [[pronoun]]s and of that in the language (not to mention the impossibility of identifying [[English relative clauses|relative clauses]] with [[pronoun]]s deletion, as in the man I saw). Particular [[Semantics|semantic]] and [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] categories (doubt, cognisance, disagreements, summaries, etc.) are difficult to locate for the same reason.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aston BNC&quot; /&gt;

===Limited situational description===
This means, for example, that while one can compare speech by men and by women, one cannot compare speech to women and to men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aston BNC&quot; /&gt;

===Inappropriate for study of highly specific text-types or genres===
The nature of the BNC being a large mixed corpus renders it unsuitable for the study of highly specific text-types or genres, as any one of them is likely to be inadequately represented and may not be recognisable from the encoding. For example, there are very few business letters and service encounters in the BNC, and those wishing to explore their specific conventions would do better to compile a small corpus including only texts of those types.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aston BNC&quot; /&gt;

==Uses of the BNC==

===English language education===
There are two general ways in which corpus material can be used in [[language]] teaching.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aston BNC&quot; /&gt;

Firstly, publishers and researchers could use corpus samples to create [[language]]-learning [[references]], syllabuses and other related tools or materials.

For example, the BNC was used by a group of Japanese researchers as a tool in their creation of an [[English language]]-learning [[website]] for learners of [[English for specific purposes]] (ESP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minn|first=Danny|coauthors=Sano, Hiroshi., Ino, Marie. &amp; Nakamura, Takahiro|title=Using the BNC to create and develop educational materials and a website for learners of English|journal=ICAME Journal|year=2005|volume=29|pages=99–113|url=http://icame.uib.no/ij29/ij29-page99-114.pdf|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The website enabled [[English language]] learners to download frequently heard and used sentence patterns, and then base their own usage of the [[English language]] on these sentence patterns. The BNC served as the source from which the frequently used expressions were extracted. In using this [[website]], users thus relied on [[reference]] samples from the BNC to guide them in their learning of the [[English language]].

Such creation of materials that facilitate language-learning typically involves the use of very large corpora (comparable to the size of the BNC), as well as advanced [[software]] and [[technology]]. A large amount of money, time and especially expertise in the field of [[computational linguistics]] are invested in the development of such language-learning material.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aston BNC&quot; /&gt;

Secondly, the analysis of corpus can be incorporated directly into the language teaching and learning environment. With this method, language learners are given the opportunity to categorize language data from the corpus and subsequently form conclusions about the patterns and features of their target language from their categorizations. This method involves a greater amount of work on the part of the language leaner and is referred to as “data-driven learning” by Tim Johns. The corpus data used for data-driven learning is relatively smaller and consequently the generalisations made about the target language may be of limited value.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aston BNC&quot; /&gt;

In general, the BNC is useful as a reference source for the purposes of producing and perceiving text. In particular, the BNC can be used as a [[reference]] source when studying the use of individual words in various contexts, so that learners become familiar with the different ways to use particular words in suitable [[contexts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Aston BNC&quot; /&gt;

Other than language-related information, encyclopedic information is also found in the BNC. Learners perusing data from the BNC are also introduced to British cultural features and [[stereotypes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Aston BNC&quot; /&gt;

===Bilingual dictionaries===
The BNC was the source of more than 12,000 words and phrases used for the production of a range of [[bilingual dictionaries]] in India in 2012, translating 22 local languages into English. This was part of a larger movement to push for improvements in education, the preservation of India's [[vernacular languages]] as well as an industry for [[translation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;india&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Bilingual dictionaries to promote India’s mother tongues|url=http://www.timesofoman.com/featuredetail.asp?fid=120|accessdate=17 March 2012|newspaper=Times of Oman|date=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tests and evaluations===
The large size of the BNC provides a large-scale resource on which to test programs.&lt;ref name=use&gt;{{cite web|title=What can I do with the BNC?|url=http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/using/index.xml|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used as a test bed for the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] (TEI) guidelines. The BNC has also been used to provide 20 million words to evaluate English subcategorization acquisition systems for the [[Senseval]] initiative for computational analysis of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Korhonen|first=Anna|year=2002|title=EVALUATION RESOURCES for English Subcategorization Acquisition Systems|url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~alk23/subcat/subcat.html|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic research projects based on the BNC===
* '''Collocational Evidence from the British National Corpus'''&lt;ref name=collocational&gt;Sebastian Hoffmann and Hans-Martin Lehmann (2000) &quot;Collocational Evidence from the British National Corpus&quot;, in John M. Kirk, ed. ''Corpora Galore: Analyses and Techniques in Describing English'' Amsterdam: Rodopi&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hoffman &amp; Lehmann (2000) explored the mechanisms behind speakers ability to manipulate their large inventory of [[collocation]]s which are ready for use and can be easily expanded grammatically or syntactically to adapt to the current speech situation. Word combinations occurring in low frequency were extracted from the BNC to offer some insight into it.&lt;ref name=collocational /&gt;

Fernandez &amp; Ginzburg (2002) investigated dialogue which is full of intuitively complete utterances that are not sentential in their outward form. These are typically short answers in response to queries.
In their investigation, a corpus-based on the non-sentential utterances (NSU) was carried out on a sub-portion of the BNC to provide a complete and theoretically grounded classification of NSUs in dialogue.&lt;ref name=nsu /&gt;

* '''A corpus-based EAP course for NNS doctoral students: Moving from available specialized corpora to self-compiled corpora'''&lt;ref name=eap&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=David|author2=John Swales|title=A corpus-based EAP course for NNS doctoral students: Moving from available specialized corpora to self-compiled corpora|journal=English for Specific Purposes|year=2006|volume=25|issue=1|pages=56–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Lee &amp; Swales (2006) designed an experimental, innovative course in corpus-informed English for Academic Purposes (EAP) for doctoral students at the English Language Institute (ELI) of the University of Michigan in the US.&lt;ref name=eap /&gt;

Participants were given access to specialized corpora of academic writing and speaking, instructed in the tools of the trade (web- &amp; PC-based concordancers) and gradually introduced to the skills needed to best exploit the data and the tools for both directed learning and self-learning. After the induction period, participants began to compile two additional written corpora: one of their own writing (term papers, unedited journal drafts) and one of 'expert' writing, selected from electronic versions of published papers in their own field or subfield. Students were thus able to make comparisons between their own writing and those of more established writers in their field.&lt;ref name=eap /&gt;

Participants used three main corpora as the basis of their investigations: Hyland’s Research Article Corpus, the Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English (MICASE) and Academic texts from the BNC.&lt;ref name=eap /&gt;

====Natural language processing====
As part of ongoing work on morphological processing, a key area of [[Natural Language Processing]] (NLP),  [[data]] from the BNC was used to test the accuracy, reliability and swiftness of computational tools developed to facilitate the analysis and processing of morphological markers in [[British English]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Minnen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minnen|first=Guido|coauthors=Carroll, John., Pearce, Darren.|title=Applied Morphological Processing of English|journal=Natural Language Engineering|year=2001|volume=7(3)|pages=207–223}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The computational tools involved a program that enabled the analysis of [[inflectional morphology]] in [[British English]] (known as an analyser) and a program that generated morphological markings based on the analysis from the analyser. [[Data]] from the BNC was also used to build up an extensive  repository of information about [[British English]] morphological markers. In particular, approximately 1,100 [[lemmas]] were extracted from the BNC and compiled into a checklist which was consulted by the morphological generator before [[verbs]] that allowed consonant doubling were accurately inflected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minnen&quot;/&gt;

==Acclaim for the BNC==
The BNC is widely considered by researchers in the field of [[computational linguistics]] and [[corpus linguistics]] as a remarkable accomplishment, given its massive collection of words. Since the BNC represents a recognizable effort to collect and subsequently process such a large amount of data, it has become an influential forerunner in the field and a model or exemplary corpus on which the development of later corpora was based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Čermák|first=František|title=Today's Corpus Linguistics: Some Open Questions|journal=International Journal of Corpus Linguistics|year=2003|volume=7|issue=2|pages=265–282|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital Medievalist''' is an [[academic]] project and community-building organization for those who are interested in the use of computers and computational techniques in the academic field of [[medieval studies]], a sub-field of [[digital humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
Digital Medievalist was established in 2003 as an international collaborative non-profit project based at [[University of Lethbridge]] in [[Canada]] but having executive board members from a number of other countries.  Although [[University of Lethbridge]] remains the main host and administrative home, the project now has a technical infrastructure which uses donated services from others including the [[University of Kentucky]]. The project grew out of a recognised need for best-practice advice on a disciplinary level in the creation of digital medieval resources.  Although much of the advice and experience of those who would call themselves digital medievalists are applicable to other areas of the [[digital humanities]] and specifically academic research projects in this area, around the time of its creation an increasing need for discipline-based communities of this nature was beginning to be recognised.&lt;ref&gt;See Brogan, M. &amp; Renfrow D. (2005), ''A Kaleidoscope of Digital American Literature'', Digital Library Federation, p. 17: 
[http://books.google.ie/books?id=m8QYpR1D58UC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;ots=kDICmd72r3&amp;sig=w09GF9bj5hcIBZBmniY1Hfgh9YY&amp;hl=en#PPA17,M1]
&lt;/ref&gt;  Partly in response to the overwhelming reception the creation of Digital Medievalist received, the [[Digital Classicist]] project was set up shortly after.

== Governance ==
=== Executive Board ===
Digital Medievalist as an organization is overseen by the volunteer efforts of a fully elected international executive board.  Its bylaws state that its 8-member board are elected by the membership for overlapping two-year terms (thus 4 positions come up for election each year), and that the board chooses a director from amongst its members.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/bylaws.html for the full bylaws&lt;/ref&gt;  Eligibility for election to the executive board is simply demonstrable participation in digital medieval activities or board-sanctioned equivalancies.  These bylaws also state its commitment to be a non-profit organization, and its general purposes and objectives.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/bylaws.html#board&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Membership ===
Membership in Digital Medievalist is free and open to all.  The sole criterion for membership is subscription to its free online discussion list 'dm-l'.  Membership conveys the right to vote in Digital Medievalist elections, and if they have contributed in some meaningful manner, eligibility to run for election to the Digital Medievalist executive board.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/bylaws.html#membership&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities of Digital Medievalist ==
[[Image:Origo Mundi kynsa gwersow.jpg|thumb|right|Opening verses of Mediaeval Cornish manuscript, of the ''Origo Mundi'']] 
Digital Medievalist sees it as its mission to provide a framework to enable members of its community to share information.  These activities include an electronic mailing list, the participation in and organisation of conference sessions or other events, and a website containing an open-access academic journal of record, a wiki/FAQ, and a facility to post news releases.&lt;ref&gt;See printed work: O'Donnell, Daniel P., 'Disciplinary Impact and Technological Obsolescence in Medieval Studies' in ''A Companion to Digital Literary Studies'', ed. by Ray Siemens and Susan Schreibman, (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2007), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The website is authored in [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI P5 XML]] and delivered with [[Apache Cocoon]].

=== Mailing List ===
Digital Medievalist runs an electronic mailing list and discussion forum ([http://listserv.uleth.ca/mailman/listinfo/dm-l dm-l]) where members of the community ask for advice, share problems, and discuss issues that affect them.  The discussion list currently has around 540 members, many of whom are drawn from widely across the [[Humanities Computing]] field.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/about/index.html#mailing&lt;/ref&gt;  The list traffic is low, with occasional bursts of interest in a particular issue, but is primarily used for announcements of interest to digital medievalists.

=== Journal ===
Digital Medievalist runs a free [[peer-reviewed]] [[Open access (publishing)|open-access]] online journal, also called 'Digital Medievalist', which acts as a journal of record for the digital medieval studies field.  In many ways this is seen as the most significant output of Digital Medievalist and is where the majority of volunteer effort is directed.  The journal has an entry in the [[Directory of Open Access Journals]] listed under the fields of both [[Computer Science]] and [[History]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=findJournals&amp;hybrid=&amp;query=Digital+Medievalist&lt;/ref&gt;  The Digital Medievalist ISSN number is 17150736, and University of Lethbridge is listed as the official publisher.  The journal accepts submissions of articles on things digital and medieval from in the 1000-10000 word range.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/about/index.html#journal&lt;/ref&gt;  Submissions should be emailed to editors _at_ digitalmedievalist.org for consideration.  The journal appears to release about one issue every year since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/journal/&lt;/ref&gt;  It has experimented with different formats of releases, for example issue 3 is a rolling-release that previously submitted articles are being added to over time, while issue 4 was a thematic issue of articles arising out of the work of a cognate organization [[Digital Classicist]] in memory of a well-known academic in the field of [[digital humanities]], [[Ross Scaife]].  In addition to experimenting with different models of publication, the project has taken an innovative stance on the problems of academic acceptance of research articles published online.  This the use of so-called 'Ostentatious Peer Review', that is, the accepting editor and the recommending reader who reviewed the article have their name listed as doing so.  The theory is that both the editors and reviewers do a better job (since their name is in evidence for everyone to see) and also by attracting big names in the [[medieval studies]] and/or [[digital humanities|humanities computing]] community, the online publication of the article may be taken more seriously by academic hiring and tenure committees.  While there is informal hearsay evidence that this might be beneficial, and certainly leads to a higher editorial standard than some online journals, there is no hard evidence (yet) that this affects hiring committees.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

=== Wiki/FAQ ===
Digital Medievalist has a [[MediaWiki]]-based wiki which it uses to store information of interest to the digital medieval research community.  Previously the wiki was quite full, but in a recent re-engineering of its technical infrastructure the old wiki pages (much laden with wiki-spam) were removed while upgrading to a new version of mediawiki.  Although the intention is to slowly add back this material, the wiki is not as robust as once was.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/wiki/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== News Server ===
Digital Medievalist has a home-grown news server, publishing and storing news using the [[Atom (standard)]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/news/&lt;/ref&gt;  Anyone is allowed to submit a news item which undergoes a moderation process by a member of the executive board before being posted.  This News Server can be used to announce new publications, software, or project, issue calls for papers, or promote conferences and congresses.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/about/index.html#newsServer&lt;/ref&gt; The atom feed is also directly available for inclusion in feed readers.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/newsServer/atom.php&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conferences and Events ===
Digital Medievalist as an umbrella group for a community interested in digital methodologies in medieval studies has organized conference sessions many years at the most prestigious academic [[Medieval studies]] conferences in existence.  For example, the International Congress on Medieval Studies&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.wmich.edu/medieval/congress/&lt;/ref&gt; organized by [[Western Michigan University]] and the International Medieval Congress&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.leeds.ac.uk/ims/imc/&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the [[University of Leeds]] amongst other conferences and events.

The '''EpiDoc''' Collaborative, building recommendations for structured [[markup language|markup]] of [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] documents in [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]] [[XML]], was originally formed in 2000 by scholars at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]: Tom Elliott, the former director of the Ancient World Mapping Center, with Hugh Cayless and Amy Hawkins. The guidelines have matured considerably through extensive discussion on the [http://lsv.uky.edu/archives/markup.html Markup list] and other discussion fora, at several conferences, and through the experience of various pilot projects. The first major&amp;mdash;but not by any means the only&amp;mdash;epigraphic project to adopt and pilot the EpiDoc recommendations were the Inscriptions of [[Aphrodisias]] and [[Vindolanda Tablets]] Online in 2002-4, and the guidelines reached a degree of stability for the first time in that period. EpiDoc has since been adopted as the native format for the Greek [[Papyrology]] site, Papyri.info.

The EpiDoc [[XML schema|schema]] and guidelines may also be applied, perhaps with some local modification to related palaeographical fields including [[Sigillography]], and [[Numismatics]].

==Guidelines and Schema==
The EpiDoc Guidelines are available in two forms:
# the stable guidelines, released periodically &lt;ref&gt;http://www.stoa.org/epidoc/gl/latest/&lt;/ref&gt;
# the source code, available in its most up-to-date form in the EpiDoc Sourceforge repository. The Guidelines source files are a series of XML documents, plus XSLT to transform them to the web version. &lt;ref&gt;http://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/guidelines/ SourceForge&lt;/ref&gt;
# the current version of the schema, which may be linked to directly by XML documents. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.stoa.org/epidoc/schema/8.16/tei-epidoc.rng &lt;/ref&gt;
# the source code, available in its most up-to-date form in the EpiDoc SourceForge repository. &lt;ref&gt;https://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/schema/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
Tool developed by and for the EpiDoc community include:
* The EpiDoc Example Stylesheets (XSLT), available from the SourceForge file repository. These stylesheets are also used to deliver the Guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;https://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/wiki/Stylesheets/&lt;/ref&gt;
* CHET-C (the Chapel Hill Electronic Text-Converter), an application originally written in VBA, then as a free-standing [[Java (programming language)|Java]] app, and now available as a self-contained [[JavaScript]] platform written by Hugh Cayless. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.stoa.org/projects/epidoc/stable/chetc-js/chetc.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Transcoder: a Java tool for converting between Beta Code, Unicode NF C, Unicode NF D, and GreekKeys encoding for Greek script on the fly.&lt;ref&gt;https://sourceforge.net/projects/epidoc/files/Transcoder/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Zealand Electronic Text Centre (NZETC)''' ({{lang-mi|Te Pūhikotuhi o Aotearoa}}) was renamed in 2012 the '''New Zealand Electronic Text Collection''' due to internal restructuring.

The New Zealand Electronic Text Collection is a collection of the library at the [[Victoria University of Wellington]] which provides a free online archive of [[New Zealand]] and [[Pacific Islands]] texts and heritage materials. The Library has an ongoing programme of digitisation and feature additions to the current holdings within the NZETC. In the beginning of 2012 the collection contained over 1,600 texts (around 65,000 pages) and received over 10,000 visits each day.&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-NZETC-About.html About NZETC] on the official website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects and activities==
The Library works with partners within Victoria University on projects for the NZETC including:
* ''Turbine'', a literary journal (in cooperation with the [[International Institute of Modern Letters]])
* ''[[Best New Zealand Poems series|Best New Zealand Poems]]'' (in cooperation with the International Institute of Modern Letters)
* ''Tidal Pools'', to make available texts on Pacific islands history, language, culture and politics (in cooperation with [[Va'aomanu Pasifika]], the Pacific Studies unit)
* ''[[Design Review (publication)|Design Review]]'', a [[Wellington]] architecture and design magazine from the late 1940s and early 1950s

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2974">'''Oxford Text Archive''' ('''OTA''') is an archive of [[electronic text]]s and other literary and language resources which have been created, collected and distributed for the purpose of research into literary and linguistic topics at the [[University of Oxford]], [[England]].

The OTA was founded by Lou Burnard of [[Oxford University Computing Services]] (OUCS) in 1976, initially as the Oxford Archive of Electronic Literature. It is thought to be one of the first archives of digital academic textual resources to collect and distribute materials from other research centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Oxford Archive of Electronic Literature|journal=Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing Bulletin|year=1977|volume=5|issue=2|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OTA continues to be hosted by OUCS, with associated research and development projects ongoing in the [[Oxford e-Research Centre]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk/ Oxford e-Research Centre], [[University of Oxford]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Faculty of [[Linguistics]], [[Philology]] and [[Phonetics]], University of Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/ Faculty of Linguistics, Philology and Phonetics], University of Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

The OTA accepts deposits of primary-source academic electronic editions and linguistic corpora, and is one of the key centres in the emerging European research infrastructure ([[CLARIN]], the Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.eu/ CLARIN], Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;). The OTA hosts many scholarly documents marked up according to the latest (P5) edition of the guidelines of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Projects/ox01.xml | title=Oxford Text Archive | work=[http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Projects/ Projects Using the TEI] | publisher=[http://www.tei-c.org/ Text Encoding Initiative] | accessdate=1 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including copies of all of the [[Eighteenth Century Collections Online]] (ECCO) texts which are now in the public domain. The OTA also manages the distribution of the [[British National Corpus]] (BNC).

From 1996 to 2008, the OTA was one of the centres of the [[Arts and Humanities Data Service]], and hosted [[AHDS Literature, Languages and Linguistics]], a national centre for the support of digital research in literary and linguistic subject areas in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3797">The '''Perseus Project''' (also known as the '''Perseus Hopper''')&lt;ref name=&quot;home&quot; /&gt; is a [[digital library]] project of [[Tufts University]], which is located in Medford and Somerville, near Boston, in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. The project assembles digital collections of [[humanities]] resources. It is hosted by the department of [[Classics]]. Suffering at times from computer [[Computer hardware|hardware]] problems, its resources occasionally are unavailable. The project is [[Mirror (computing) |mirrored]] by the [[Max Planck Society]] in [[Berlin]], Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ Berlin Perseus mirror]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://perseus.uchicago.edu/ Chicago Perseus mirror]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The project was founded in 1987 to collect and present materials for study of [[ancient Greece]]. It has published two [[CD-ROM]]s and established the Perseus Digital Library on the [[World Wide Web]] in 1995. The project has expanded its original scope. Current collections cover Greco-Roman classics and the [[English Renaissance]]. Other materials, such as the papers of [[Edwin Bolles]] and the history of Tufts University, have been moved into the [[Tufts Digital Library]].

The editor-in-chief of the project is [[Gregory Crane]], the Tufts Winnick Family Chair in Technology and Entrepreneurship. He has held that position since the founding of the Perseus Project.

== Text format ==
Ancient Greek works in Perseus are stored as [[beta code]], although they may be reformatted for display into a variety of transcription systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Help/fonthelp.html Greek Font Display Help]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:TheSWORDProjectLogo.gif|right]]'''The SWORD Project''' is the CrossWire Bible Society's free Bible software project. Its purpose is to create cross-platform [[open source]] tools—covered by the [[GNU General Public License]]—that allow [[programmer]]s and [[Bible society|Bible societies]] to write new [[Bible software]] more quickly and easily.

==Overview==
The core of The SWORD Project is a [[cross-platform]] [[Library (computing)|library]] written in [[C++]], providing access, search functions and other utilities to a growing collection of over 200 texts in over 50 languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;p-s&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-115254414.html|title=Religion Meets Computer Revolution|accessdate=2008-03-17|date=2004-04-11|author=Al Fasoldt|work=The Post-Standard (Syracuse, New York)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any software based on their [[Application programming interface|API]] can use this collection.

JSword is a separate implementation, written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], which reproduces most of the API features of the C++ API and supports most SWORD data content.

The project is one of the primary implementers of and contributors to the [[Open Scripture Information Standard]] (OSIS), a standardized [[XML]] language for the encoding of scripture. The software is also capable of utilizing certain resources encoded in using the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] (TEI) format and maintains deprecated support for [[Theological Markup Language]] (ThML) and [[General Bible Format]] (GBF).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5396">The '''Northeastern University Women Writers Project''' (formerly the '''Brown University Women Writers Project''') or '''WWP''', founded in 1986 at [[Brown University]], is a long-term research and publication project which focuses on making texts from early modern women writers in the English language  available online. The Women Writers Project maintains &quot;Women Writers Online&quot; an [[electronic publishing|electronic]] collection of rare or difficult to obtain works written or co-authored by women from the sixteenth century to the mid nineteenth century. In addition, the WWP is actively engaged in researching the complex issues involved in representing manuscripts and early printed texts in [[Digital data|digital]] form and holds an occasional conference, ''Women in the Archives,'' as well as teaching workshops in text encoding and other practices central to [[digital humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wwp.brown.edu/about/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Brown University Women Writers Project developed at the end of the 1980s from the marriage of two communities, [[early modern]] [[women’s studies]] and electronic [[text encoding]].

As a method of preservation and to make the texts more widely accessible, the WWP transcribed an initial digital collection of about 200 texts in the first five years and experimented with publishing editions of selected works in traditional print format. The 15-volume series “Women Writers in English, 1350–1850” is still available.

In 1993, with the publication of the expanded [[Text Encoding Initiative]] or [[TEI]] guidelines, the WWP began a three-year period of research on how to use the new guidelines to represent early women’s texts. During this time, few new texts were added to the collection, but a new set of encoding methods and improved systems of documentation and training took place.

From 1996 onwards, new texts were once again encoded with the new [[TEI]] standards. Between 1997 and 2000, funded by a grant from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], the WWP developed “Renaissance Women Online,” a project studying the impact of electronic texts on teaching and research. The project included the creation of introductory materials for 100 texts, currently constituting a sub-collection of Women Writers Online. In 1999 Women Writers Online was published, making the corpus available online.

Since the release of Women Writers Online, initiatives include publishing a Guide to Scholarly Text Encoding, offering [[workshops]] and [[seminars]] in [[text encoding]], and hosting a periodic [[Academic conference|conference]], ''Women in the Archives.''

In 2013 the WWP moved from [[Brown University]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] to [[Northeastern University]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].

==Women Writers Online==
Women Writers Online is a full-text collection of early women’s writing in [[English language|English]] ranging from 1526 to 1850. Currently, the database contains over 340 individual works, with around fifteen new texts being added to the collection every year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wwp.brown.edu/wwo/&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus of the corpus is currently on hard to find or generally inaccessible texts from both well known and more obscure writers. 
Authors included in the corpus include, among many others:
* [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld]]
* [[Aphra Behn]]
* [[Margaret Cavendish]]
* [[Queen Elizabeth I]]
* [[Margaret Fell]]
* [[Felicia Hemans]]
* [[Catherine Parr]]
* [[Mary Sidney]]
* [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]

Access to Women Writers Online is available through a [[web-based]] interface with a paid subscription, available to both institutions and individuals. There is also a free one-month trial period for potential subscribers. The WWP usually makes their textbase available free of charge for the month of March, in honor of [[Women's History Month]].

In March 2012, the WWP released a new interface for Women Writers Online.

==Resources &amp; Outreach==
The WWP hosts a number of [[text encoding]] workshops and seminars throughout the year for various skill levels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wwp.brown.edu/outreach/seminars/&lt;/ref&gt; From 2008 through 2011 the WWP also hosted an annual conference ''Women in the Archives'' in collaboration with the [[Sarah Doyle Women's Center]] and several other groups at [[Brown University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wwp.brown.edu/outreach/conference/&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Women Writers Online collection, the WWP also offers some public resources helpful for researchers and teachers interested in [[early modern]] [[women writers]]. These include orientations for getting the most out of researching within the online collection, possible [[assignments]] that take advantage of the online [[user interface]], and [[syllabi]] submitted by professors that incorporate the online texts and focus on courses in [[Renaissance]] and [[early modern]] [[literature]], [[women’s studies]], and related subjects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wwp.brown.edu/wwo/teaching/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1501">'''Xaira''' is an XML Aware Indexing and Retrieval Architecture developed at Oxford University. It is based on SARA, an [[Standard Generalized Markup Language|SGML]]-aware  text-searching system originally developed for searching the [[British National Corpus]]. Xaira has been redeveloped as a generic [[XML]] system for constructing query-systems for any kind of XML data, in particular for  use with [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]]. The current Windows implementation is intended for non-specialist users. A more sophisticated and open-source version is currently under development. This version supports cross-platform working using standards such as [[XML-RPC]] and [[SOAP]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2693">'''Open Scripture Information Standard''' ('''OSIS''') is an [[XML]] application (or [[XML schema|schema]]), that defines tags for [[Markup language|marking up]] Bibles, theological commentaries, and other related literature.

The OSIS schema was developed by the Bible Technologies Group, a joint committee sponsored by the [[American Bible Society]] and the [[Society of Biblical Literature]]. Other participants in the standards work are the [[United Bible Societies]], [[SIL International]], and various national Bible societies, along with individual expert volunteers. The officers include [[Steven DeRose]] (chair), [[Kees DeBlois]] (vice-chair), and [[Patrick Durusau]] (editor). As of mid-2006, the current version is 2.1.1. 

The schema is very similar to that of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]], though on the one hand much simpler (by omission of many unneeded constructs), and on the other hand adding much more detailed [[metadata]], and a formal canonical reference system to identify books, chapters, verses, and particular locations within verses.

The metadata includes a &quot;work declaration&quot; for the work itself, and for each work it references. A work declaration provides basic catalog information based on the [[Dublin Core]] standard, and assigns a local short name for the work (similar to [[XML namespace]] declarations).

OSIS gives particular attention to encoding [[overlapping markup]], because Bibles exhibit such markup frequently, for example verses crossing paragraph boundaries and vice versa. The OSIS schema introduced a method for encoding overlap in XML, known as [[Trojan milestones]], or &quot;Clix&quot;.&lt;ref name=DeRose2004&gt;Steven DeRose, ''[http://xml.coverpages.org/DeRoseEML2004.pdf Markup Overlap: A Review and a Horse],'' Proceedings of the Extreme Markup (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Syd Bauman, ''[http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2005/Bauman01/EML2005Bauman01.html TEI HORSEing Around],''{{Dead link|date=April 2009}}  Proceedings of the Extreme Markup (2005), (http://en.scientificcommons.org/43599936 Abstract)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1473">'''Freedict''' is a collection of free bilingual dictionaries, licensed under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL). 

The primary format of the dictionaries is [[XML]] complying to the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] ''Guidelines''. Most dictionaries have databases in the [[DICT]] format. Other occasionally available formats include [[Stardict]], zbedic, Evolutionary Dictionary and Opendict. Some [[Linux distribution]]s (such as [[Debian]]) provide the Freedict dictionaries as easily installable packages. [[StarDict]] can make a good front-end for daily use of Freedict.

As of November 2009, the project hosts [http://sourceforge.net/projects/freedict/files/ 70 bilingual dictionaries] of various sizes.

The dictionaries can be used via [[DICT]] clients (standalone and plugins, both locally and remotely), DICT WWW interfaces, and directly in a browser (source XML + CSS).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17613">[[File:Text Encoding Initiative TEI-800.jpg|thumb|Official logo]]
The '''Text Encoding Initiative''' ('''TEI''') is a [[written language|text-centric]] [[community of practice]] in the [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] of [[digital humanities]], operating continuously since the 1980s. The community currently runs a mailing list, meetings and conference series, and maintains an [[eponymous]] [[technical standard]], a [[wiki]], a [[SourceForge]] repository and a [[toolchain]].

==The TEI Guidelines==

The ''TEI Guidelines'', which collectively define an XML format, are the defining output of the community of practice. The format differs from other well-known [[open formats]] for text (such as [[HTML]] and [[OpenDocument]]) in that it's primarily semantic rather than presentational; the semantics and interpretation of every tag and attribute are specified.
Some 500 different textual components and concepts
(&lt;tt&gt;word&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-w.html|title=Element w (word)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;sentence&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-w.html|title=Element s (s-unit)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;character&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-c.html|title=Element c (character)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;glyph&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-g.html|title=Element g (character or glyph)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;person&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-person.html|title=Element person (person)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
etc.); each is grounded in one or more academic discipline and examples are given.

===Technical Details===

The standard is split into two parts, a discursive textual description with extended examples and discussion and set of tag-by-tag definitions. Schemata in most of the modern formats ([[Document Type Definition|DTD]], [[RELAX NG]] and [[W3C Schema]]) are generated automatically from the tag-by-tag definitions. A number of tools support the production of the guidelines and the application of the guidelines to specific projects.

A number of special tags are used to circumvent restrictions imposed by the underlying [[Unicode]]; &lt;tt&gt;glyph&lt;/tt&gt; to allow representation of characters that don't qualify for Unicode inclusion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-w.html|title=Element w (word)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; to allow overcome the required strict linearity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-w.html|title=Element w (word)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many users of the format don't use the complete range of tags but produce a customisation with a subset of the tags. The format supports this by grouping tags into sets, each corresponding to a chapter in the TEI guidelines and a group of related academic disciplines. Some users of the format go further and describe a [[schematron]] stylesheet embodying their local [[house style]] to make publishing the content easier.

''TEI Lite'' is an [[XML]]-based [[file format]] for exchanging texts.  It is a manageable selection from the extensive set of elements available in the full TEI Guidelines.

===Examples===

The text of the TEI guidelines is rich in examples and all the examples here are taken from there. There is also a samples page on the TEI wiki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Samples_of_TEI_texts |title=Samples of TEI texts |work=wiki.tei-c.org |year=2011 |accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives examples of real-world projects which expose their underlying TEI for elucidation and reuse.

====Prose tags====

TEI allows texts to be marked up semantically at any level of granularity, or mixture of granularities. For example this paragraph (p) has been marked up into sentences (s) and clauses (cl).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AI.html#AILCW |title=17 Simple Analytic Mechanisms - TEI P5: — Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange |work=tei-c.org |year=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;

 &lt;s&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;It was about the beginning of September, 1664,
  &lt;cl&gt;that I, among the rest of my neighbours,
       heard in ordinary discourse
   &lt;cl&gt;that the plague was returned again to Holland; &lt;/cl&gt;
   &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;for it had been very violent there, and particularly at
     Amsterdam and Rotterdam, in the year 1663, &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;whither, &lt;cl&gt;they say,&lt;/cl&gt; it was brought,
  &lt;cl&gt;some said&lt;/cl&gt; from Italy, others from the Levant, among some goods
  &lt;cl&gt;which were brought home by their Turkey fleet;&lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;others said it was brought from Candia;
     others from Cyprus. &lt;/cl&gt;
 &lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;It mattered not &lt;cl&gt;from whence it came;&lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;but all agreed &lt;cl&gt;it was come into Holland again.&lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
 &lt;/s&gt;

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Verse====

TEI has tags for marking up verse, this example (taken from the French translation of the TEI Guidelines) shows a sonnet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/fr/html/ref-lg |title=TEI element lg (groupe de vers) |work=tei-c.org |year=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;div type=&quot;sonnet&quot;&gt;
 &lt;lg type=&quot;quatrain&quot;&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Les amoureux fervents et les savants austères&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Aiment également, dans leur mûre saison,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Les chats puissants et doux, orgueil de la maison,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Qui comme eux sont frileux et comme eux sédentaires.&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
 &lt;lg type=&quot;quatrain&quot;&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Amis de la science et de la volupté&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Ils cherchent le silence et l'horreur des ténèbres ;&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; L'Érèbe les eût pris pour ses coursiers funèbres,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; S'ils pouvaient au servage incliner leur fierté.&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
 &lt;lg type=&quot;tercet&quot;&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Ils prennent en songeant les nobles attitudes&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Des grands sphinx allongés au fond des solitudes,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Qui semblent s'endormir dans un rêve sans fin ;&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
 &lt;lg type=&quot;tercet&quot;&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Leurs reins féconds sont pleins d'étincelles magiques,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Et des parcelles d'or, ainsi qu'un sable fin,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Étoilent vaguement leurs prunelles mystiques.&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Choice tag====

The &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; tag is used to represent sections of text for which there are more than one possible option. In the following example, based on one in the standard, &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; is used twice, once to indicate an original and a corrected year and once to indicate an original and regularised spelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-choice.html |title=TEI element &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; |work=tei-c.org |year=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;p xml:id=&quot;p23&quot;&gt;Lastly, That, upon his solemn oath to observe all the above
articles, the said man-mountain shall have a daily allowance of
meat and drink sufficient for the support of &lt;choice&gt;
  &lt;sic&gt;1724&lt;/sic&gt;
  &lt;corr&gt;1728&lt;/corr&gt;
 &lt;/choice&gt; of our subjects,
with free access to our royal person, and other marks of our
&lt;choice&gt;
  &lt;orig&gt;favour&lt;/orig&gt;
  &lt;reg&gt;favor&lt;/reg&gt;
 &lt;/choice&gt;.

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==ODD==

'''One Document Does it all''' (&quot;ODD&quot;) is a [[literate programming]] language for [[XML schema]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|year=2004|last1=Bauman|first1=Syd|last2=Flanders|first2=Julia|contribution=ODD customizations|title=Extreme Markup Languages 2004|url=http://conferences.idealliance.org/extreme/html/2004/Bauman01/EML2004Bauman01.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|year=2004|last1=Burnard|first1=Lou|last2=Rahtz|first2=Sebastian|contribution=RelaxNG with Son of ODD|title=Extreme Markup Languages 2004|url=http://conferences.idealliance.org/extreme/html/2004/Burnard01/EML2004Burnard01.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Literate Documentation for XML|last=Reiss|first=Kevin M.|publisher=Digital Humanities 2007|location=Urbana-Champaign, Illinois|year=2007|url=http://dhcommons.tamu.edu/sites/default/files/poster_208_reiss.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper|title=A complete schema definition language for the Text Encoding Initiative|first1=Lou|last1=Burnard|first2=Sebastian|last2=Rahtz|year=2013|month=June|journal=XML London 2013|doi=10.14337/XMLLondon13.Rahtz01|url=http://xmllondon.com/2013/presentations/rahtz/|pages=152–161|isbn=978-0-9926471-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In literate-programming style, ODD documents combine human-readable documentation and machine-readable models using the  Documentation Elements module of the Text Encoding Initiative. Tools generate [[Internationalization and localization|localised and internationalised]] [[HTML]], [[ePub]], or [[PDF]] human-readable output and [[Document Type Definition|DTD]]s, [[XML Schema (W3C)|W3C XML Schema]], [[RELAX NG|Relax NG]] Compact Syntax, or Relax NG XML Syntax machine-readable output.

The Roma web application&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tei-c.org/Roma/ Roma web application].&lt;/ref&gt; is built around the ODD format and can use it to  generate schemas in [[Document Type Definition|DTD]], [[XML Schema (W3C)|W3C XML Schema]], [[RELAX NG|Relax NG]] Compact Syntax, or Relax NG XML Syntax formats, as used by many XML validation tools and services.

ODD is that format used internally by the Text Encoding Initiative for their [[eponymous]] [[technical standard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|year=2007|editor1-first=Lou|editor1-last=Burnard|editor2-first=Syd|editor2-last=Bauman|title=TEI P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange|publisher=TEI Consortium|location=Charlottesville, Virginia, USA|url=http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although ODD files generally describe the difference between a customized XML format and the full TEI model, ODD also can be used to describe XML formats that are entirely separate from the TEI.  One example of this is the [[W3C| W3C's]] [[Internationalization Tag Set]] which uses the ODD format to generate schemas and document its vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/its/ W3C ITS] and [http://www.w3.org/TR/its/itstagset.xml TEI ODD file].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Best Practices for XML Internationalization|editor1-last=Savourel|editor1-first=Yves|editor2-last=Kosek|editor2-first=Jirka|editor3-last=Ishida|editor3-first=Richard|publisher=W3C Working Group|year=2008|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-i18n-bp/|contribution=5.2 ITS and TEI}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==TEI customizations==

TEI customizations are specializations of the TEI XML specification for use in particular fields or by specific communities.

* [[EpiDoc]] (Epigraphic Documents)
* [[Music Encoding Initiative]]
* [http://www.cei.lmu.de/ Charters Encoding Initiative]
* [http://www.menota.org/ Medieval Nordic Text Archive (Menota)]

Customization in the TEI is done through the ODD mechanism mentioned above. In truth since its P5 version, all so-called 'TEI Conformant' uses of the TEI Guidelines are based on a TEI customization documented in a TEI ODD file. Even when users choose one of the off-the-shelf pre-generated schemas to validate against, these have been created from freely available customization files.

==Projects==
The format is used by many projects worldwide. Practically all projects are associated with one or more universities. Some well-known projects that encode texts using TEI include:

==History==
Prior to the creation of TEI, humanities scholars had no common standards for encoding electronic texts in a manner which would serve their academic goals (Hockey 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;41).  In 1987, a group of scholars representing fields in humanities, linguistics, and computing convened at Vassar College to put forth a set of guidelines known as the “Poughkeepsie Principles”. These guidelines directed the development of the first TEI standard, &quot;P1&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahronheim|first=J.R.|title=Descriptive metadata: Emerging standards.|journal=Journal of Academic Librarianship|year=1998|volume=24|issue=5|pages=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cantara |first=L.|title=The text-encoding initiative: Part 1|journal=OCLC Systems &amp; Services|year=2005|volume=21|issue=1|pages=36–39|doi=10.1108/10650750510578136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''1987''' Work on what would become the TEI started by  the [http://ach.org/ Association for Computers and the Humanities], the [[Association for Computational Linguistics]], and the [[Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Historical background&quot;, [http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AB.html#ABTEI section iv.2] of TEI P5:  Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange.&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated in the ''Closing statement of the Vassar Planning Conference''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/Vault/SC/teipcp1.txt |title= Closing statement of the Vassar Planning Conference |work=tei-c.org |year=2009 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*  '''1994''' TEI P3 released&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/|title=TEI Guidelines|accessdate=2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  co-edited by  Lou Burnard (at [[Oxford University]]) and [[Michael Sperberg-McQueen]] (then at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], later at the [[W3C]]).

* '''1999''' TEI P3 updated.

* '''2002''' TEI P4 released, moving from SGML to XML; adoption of [[Unicode]], which XML parsers are required to support.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=XML Basics|chapter=2|url=http://www.xmlnews.org/docs/xml-basics.html |accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''2007''' TEI P5 released, including integration with the &lt;code&gt;xml:lang&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xml:id&lt;/code&gt; attributes from the W3C&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/ http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/]&lt;/ref&gt; (these had previously been attributes in the TEI namespace), regularization of local pointing attributes to use the hash (as used in HTML) and unification of the ptr and xptr tags. Together these changes with many more new additions make P5 more regular and bring it closer to current xml practice as promoted by the [[W3C]] and as used by other XML variants. Maintenance and feature update versions of TEI P5 have been released at least twice a year since 2007.

* '''2011''' TEI P5 v2.0.1 released with support for [[Genetic editing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/readme-2.0.1.html |title=P5 version 2.0.1 release notes |work=tei-c.org |year=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (among many other additions the [[Genetic editing]] features allow encoding of texts without interpretation as to their specific semantics.)

[[File:KoninklijkeBibliotheek2.jpg|thumb|The Huygens Institute is housed in the same building as the [[RKD]], the National Archives, the Nederlands Letterkundig Museum (LM), the [[Netherlands Music Institute]] (NMI) and the [[National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]].]]
The '''Biografisch Portaal''' (Biography Portal) is an initiative based at the [[Huygens Institute for Dutch History]] in [[The Hague]], with the aim of making biographical texts of the Netherlands more accessible.

The project was started in February 2010 with material for 40,000 digitized biographies, with the goal to grant digital access to all reliable information about (deceased) people of the Netherlands from the earliest beginnings of history up to modern times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denederlandsegrondwet.nl/9353000/1/j9vvihlf299q0sr/vickk0yn4tz3?ctx=vh511aqp95x8 article] on government website of the Dutch constitution&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netherlands as a geographic term includes former colonies, and the term &quot;people&quot; refers both to people born in the Netherlands and its former colonies, and also to people born elsewhere but active in the Netherlands and its former colonies. As of 2011, only biographical information about deceased people is included. The system used is based on the standards of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]]. Access to the Biografisch Portaal is available free through a web-based interface.

The project is a cooperative undertaking by ten scientific and cultural bodies in the Netherlands with the Huygens Institute as main contact. The other bodies are:
*The Biografie Instituut
*The [[Centraal Bureau voor Genealogie]] (CBG)
*The [[Digital Library for Dutch Literature]] (DBNL)
*[[Data Archiving and Networked Services]] (DANS)
*The [[International Institute of Social History]] (IISG)
*The [[Onderzoekscentrum voor Geschiedenis en Cultuur]] (OGC),
*The [[Parlementair Documentatie Centrum]] (PDC)
*The [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] (RKD)

Besides ongoing digital projects, Dutch biographical dictionaries originally published in book form that have been digitized and incorporated into the indexes of the Biografisch Portaal are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biografischportaal.nl/about/collecties List of collections] on the Biografisch Portaal website&lt;/ref&gt;
* The work of [[Abraham van der Aa]], which was the first Dutch biographical dictionary
* The BWN, or ''[[Biografisch Woordenboek van Nederland]]''
* The NNBW, or ''[[Nieuw Nederlandsch Biografisch Woordenboek]]''
* The work of [[Johan Engelbert Elias]] on the Amsterdam regency known as ''Vroedschap van Amsterdam''
* The work of [[Barend Glasius]] known as ''Godgeleerd Nederland''
* The work of [[Roeland van Eynden]] and [[Adriaan van der Willigen]], known as ''Geschiedenis der vaderlandsche schilderkunst''
* The work of [[Jan van Gool]] known as ''Nieuwe Schouburg''
* The work of [[Jacob Campo Weyerman]] known as ''[[The Lives of Dutch painters and paintresses]]''&lt;ref&gt;This is the only indexed dictionary that cannot be accessed from IP addresses outside of Dutch university libraries&lt;/ref&gt;
* The BLNP, or ''[[Biografisch lexicon voor de geschiedenis van het Nederlands protestantisme]]''

As of November 2012 the Biografisch Portaal contained 80,206 persons in 125,592 biographies. In February 2012, a new project was started called &quot;BiographyNed&quot; to build an analytical tool for use with the Biografisch Portaal that will link biographies to events in time and space.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huygens.knaw.nl/toekenning-biographyned-huygens-ing-vu&lt;/ref&gt; The main goal of the three-year project is to formulate ‘the boundaries of the Netherlands’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.let.vu.nl/en/events/news/2012/grant-for-ehumanities-project-biographyned.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
