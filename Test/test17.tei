      <p>Email in Oxford is part of the <ref target="../nexus">Nexus service</ref>, run by the
        University Computing Services (OUCS). Nexus gives you access to a number of services in
        addition to email, such as calendars, address book and the option of sharing information
        with other Nexus users. </p>
      <!-- <p>All new members of the University are automatically given an Oxford Username and an email
        account once a University card has been issued.
        Details about your account and your
          activation code are sent to your University address (college or department).
          Please allow several days after receiving
          your card for the email account details to reach you. If you haven't received your account
          details and activation code, please contact the <xref url="../helpcentre/">OUCS help

      <p>This document offers information about email at Oxford in general. The <ref target="../nexus/">Nexus pages</ref> offer specific information about the Nexus service,
        such as set-up and configuration details.</p>

      <!-- <p>Once you have your Oxford account details, go to
        https://register.oucs.ox.ac.uk/self/user_info?display=mailin to find your mail address.
        Oxford Nexus offers an easy-to-use, fully featured web-based email service which is
        accessible from web browsers anywhere on the Internet. Email clients such as Outlook,
        Outlook Express, MacMail and Mozilla Thunderbird are also easily configured to work with
        Oxford Nexus. Email Client Configuration pages have details for popular email clients.
        Please note: Oxford Nexus only accepts secure connections from email clients. Please follow
        our client configuration instructions to make sure that you connect to Oxford Nexus
        securely. Failure to do so will mean you cannot access your Oxford Nexus email account. Some
        University departments run their own internal mail servers which they may require their
        members to use. Departmental IT staff will advise you about such systems. </p>

          <hi>New University members</hi>
          <lb/>All new members of the University are automatically given an Oxford Username and an
          email account once a University card has been issued. Details about the Oxford account
          (which is also known as the Single Sign-On account or SSO) are sent to your University
          address (college or department). Please allow several days after receiving your card for
          the email account details to reach you. If you haven't received your account details and
          activation code, please contact the <ref target="../helpcentre/">OUCS help centre</ref>. </p>
        <p>Before you can start using your Oxford account you need to activate it. Go to the <ref target="https://webauth.ox.ac.uk/">Webauth page</ref> and enter your activation code which
          you will find in the letter with your account details.</p>
        <p>The SSO account is not only used for email but is also the means by which you get access
          to a range of Oxford services (see the <ref target="/webauth/oxfordusername.xml">Oxford
            username page</ref> for details).</p>
        <p>
          <hi>Access your email</hi>
          <lb/>You can access your Oxford email in different ways; directly online or via a program
          (client) installed on your computer (or mobile device). Users of Microsoft clients (such
          as Outlook or Entourage) get access other features in addition to email (such as calendar,
          address book, to-do lists). If you choose to use an email client, you have to set it up.

          clients, are available on the <ref target="../../nexus/email/">Nexus email</ref> page. <list>

        <head>Using Nexus email</head>
        <p><hi>Ways to access Nexus</hi><lb/>You can access your Nexus email either directly online,
          using the Nexus Outlook Web Access interface, or via a special program ('client')
          installed on your computer or mobile device. If you use the online interface or a
          Microsoft client, you will also be able to see your calendar, use the shared address book
          and other Nexus features.</p>
        <p>Different email programs have different functions, so what you can do and how you do it
          depends on what program you are using. Functions you will find in most programs include
          adding a signature to your outgoing messages (text that is automatically inserted to the
          bottom of messages you send, usually your contact details), automatically moving messages
          into specific mail folders, filtering out junk mail/spam, and setting an 'out-of-office'
          message. <list>

          were put there. Of course you may pre-empt this by clearing out those folders deliberately
          before the 90 days are reached and it is even possible that your email program (your
          'client') may be set to do this for you. You can set the level of junk-mail filtering via

        <p><hi>Quota</hi><lb/>Everyone who has an account on Nexus has a certain amount of space
          they can use. This is called the quota. It is currently set at 2GB (those few people with
          a quota in excess of 2 GB on the old Herald system keep their previous quota). If all your
          messages are text, this is a lot of space. However, if you receive messages that contain
          graphics or other complicated documents, you may find that you use a lot of your
          quota.</p>
        <p>If you are filling up your quota, you will not be able to receive messages until you have
          cleared enough space. You can check your quota on the <xref

        <head>Unwanted email (viruses, spam, junk-email)</head>
        <p>We all receive unwanted email, sometimes of an offensive nature. It is very hard to
          totally avoid this, but it can usually be contained to a mere irritation. Most incoming
          mail is scanned in order to tag junk mail, and OUCS recommends <ref target="filter/">applying a filter to screen you from the worst excesses</ref>. </p>
        <p>OUCS will take action against any Oxford user who is identified as having originated or
          passed on junk or chain mail. Serious cases will be referred to the Proctors.</p>

          <item>All email users will almost certainly receive occasional fake emails (also know as
            "phishing") trying to persuade them to provide personal details, passwords, credit card
            numbers etc. by various means such as linking to a fraudulent web site. Read some tips
            about <ref target="fake/">How to Recognise Fake Emails</ref>. Often <ref target="headers/">Viewing the Full Email Headers</ref> can provide clues about the authenticity of a

            protect other users and the University as a whole.</item>
          <label>Viruses</label>
          <item>Computer viruses are commonly spread by email. Your email is <ref target="scanning/">scanned centrally</ref> to detect viruses and junk mail. Messages containing viruses
            are deleted, and junk mail is tagged so that you can filter it out. Most email clients
            will allow you to set up filters, either to automatically delete unwanted messages, or
            put messages in appropriate folder (see information about your email program for
            details). OUCS maintain a set of detailed web pages about <ref target="/viruses/">Viruses</ref> and how to deal with them.</item>
          <label>Harassment</label>
          <item>Sometimes people may receive offensive mail that is directed to them personally. If
            a user is persistently harassed, or is threatened by email, then there are various
            measure that can be taken to shield them. If you are in this situation, then please
            contact <ref target="../helpcentre/">OUCS Help Centre</ref> (telephone (2)73200), and we
            shall arrange for one of our staff to discuss this with you confidentially. The Proctors
            regard any form of harassment as a serious University offence, and will deal severely
            with cases originating from within the University.</item>
          <label>Secure email</label>
          <item>Email is not a very secure medium. You can protect your privacy by encoding the
            email message before it is sent (using a system such as Pretty Good Privacy, PGP), and
            you can make a secure connection to the mail server (using SSL). PGP and SSL are
