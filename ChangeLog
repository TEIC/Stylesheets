This is a fix for both of those problems (transformtei not correctly documenting switch, teianttasks.xml not passing switch to stylesheets).

	Fix: Move template for <teix:egXML> from html_oddprocessing to html_tagdocs. This fixes the problem found in Test2/ in which <teix:egXML> elements were being completely dropped, and does not seem to change the results of the Guidelines build at all (i.e., that still works and gives proper anchors in all <teix:egXML>s).

	add new parameters $japaneseFont, $chineseFont, and $koreanFont
	and set NOTO as default. Closes #132, closes #148

	update expected results to fix the build
	NB: this only tries to fix the default build stylesheets-dev against guidelines-master (aka current release version of p5subset.xml).

2020-06-01  Syd Bauman  <s.bauman@neu.edu>

	Try to fix build: I am not sure, but I think this commit simply reverses a recent one. We are caught in dev-vs-current cycle, here. With this commit, I believe that Stylesheets_dev against P5_dev should pass the tests; however, Stylesheets_dev aaginst P5_released (current) will not (with a diff error in test.rng due to changes to lexicographic attrs). I am not sure what, if anything, could be done to get both to pass simultaneously.

	Fix Test/: Fixed Test/ portion of build process by copying 2 particular output files to expected results, pretty much exactly what @martindholmes and I did on Fri 29 May in Test2/, but apparently forgot to do in Test/.

	Adjusted odd2json to look for class types from a source file when not found in the local ODD. This will help supporting non-compiled ODDs. Updated tests.

2019-01-12  Peter Stadler  <stadlerpeter@yahoo.fr>

2018-12-08  Syd Bauman  <s.bauman@neu.edu>

	Update testPure1, step 7: Add tests for <dataRef> with key= or name=, and restriction=. Note that one of these tests worked, in that it found a Stylesheets problem. See #349.

	Update testPure1, step 6: 1) Delete att.lexicographic instead of att.deprecated, just to be clear that we are testing the deletion of something that is not included. (Since previous versions of this schema have included 'tagdocs', and even this version sucks in some elements therefrom.) 2) Change the alteration of synch= to be a deletion thereof to match the comment. I.e., synch= should not be included in output schemas, and thus invalid.

2018-12-07  Syd Bauman  <s.bauman@neu.edu>

	Update testPure1, step 5: Delete the <join> and <joinGrp> elements from testPure1 schema using <elementSpec>.

	Update testPure1, step 4: Replace reference to module 'tagdocs' and replace with references to elements <gi>, <att>, and <val>. Add a test to ensure that <tag> is invalid.

	Update testPure1, step 3: Move reference to module 'linking' from middle-of-pack to up where all the other simple <moduleRef>s are. This has profound effects on what the output RNG looks like, but should have no effect on what it validates. I have checked against all the XML files in the inputFiles/ directory, and the same number of error messages are issued for each.

	Update testPure1, step 2: Change order of <moduleRef> declarations so that those that are simple (i.e., have no attrs) come first. This has profound effects on what the output RNG looks like, but should have no effect on what it validates. I have checked against all the XML files in the imnputFiles/ directory, and the same number of error messages are issued for each. Also use phrase-level encoding in the <desc>.

	Update testPure1, step 1: Just a change to the order of and whitespace between the attributes and namespace declarations on the outermost <TEI> element. Nothing else. Should cause no appreciable change at all. But requires different expected results, as the order is propegated through to the output.

	Revert testPure1: Revert the testPure1.odd file in preparation for re-introducing each change I made one at a time.

2018-11-23  martindholmes  <mholmes@uvic.ca>

	Removing -Dregenerate support, since it's risky and not the ideal approach.

2018-11-19  Syd Bauman  <s.bauman@neu.edu>

	Fix #334: During today's Stylesheets group conference call we fixed ticket #334 by adding a template that simply ingores <cb>, <gb>, and <milestone> elements. It is possible, if not outright likely, that in the future we will have to do better than just ignoring them, but at least now FO can be produced w/o this error forcing the build to fail.
