2019-01-20  raffazizzi  <raffaeleviglianti@gmail.com>

	Adjusted odd2json to look for class types from a source file when not found in the local ODD. This will help supporting non-compiled ODDs. Updated tests.

2019-01-12  Peter Stadler  <stadlerpeter@yahoo.fr>

	create output directories if needed #351
	this should be safe since `-p` does not throw an error for existing directories and creates parent directories if needed

	… to exit immediately if some command returns a non-zero status.

2019-01-06  Syd Bauman  <s.bauman@neu.edu>

	add test: Added better testing of minOccurs= and maxOccurs= (in part to set up testing for when we try to fix #354).

2019-01-04  Syd Bauman  <s.bauman@neu.edu>

	Markdown fix in readme.

	Adding a readme to document the ODD file processing.

2018-12-08  Syd Bauman  <s.bauman@neu.edu>

	Update testPure1, step 7: Add tests for <dataRef> with key= or name=, and restriction=. Note that one of these tests worked, in that it found a Stylesheets problem. See #349.

	Update testPure1, step 6: 1) Delete att.lexicographic instead of att.deprecated, just to be clear that we are testing the deletion of something that is not included. (Since previous versions of this schema have included 'tagdocs', and even this version sucks in some elements therefrom.) 2) Change the alteration of synch= to be a deletion thereof to match the comment. I.e., synch= should not be included in output schemas, and thus invalid.

2018-12-07  Syd Bauman  <s.bauman@neu.edu>

	Update testPure1, step 5: Delete the <join> and <joinGrp> elements from testPure1 schema using <elementSpec>.

	Update testPure1, step 4: Replace reference to module 'tagdocs' and replace with references to elements <gi>, <att>, and <val>. Add a test to ensure that <tag> is invalid.

	Update testPure1, step 3: Move reference to module 'linking' from middle-of-pack to up where all the other simple <moduleRef>s are. This has profound effects on what the output RNG looks like, but should have no effect on what it validates. I have checked against all the XML files in the inputFiles/ directory, and the same number of error messages are issued for each.

	Update testPure1, step 2: Change order of <moduleRef> declarations so that those that are simple (i.e., have no attrs) come first. This has profound effects on what the output RNG looks like, but should have no effect on what it validates. I have checked against all the XML files in the imnputFiles/ directory, and the same number of error messages are issued for each. Also use phrase-level encoding in the <desc>.

	Update testPure1, step 1: Just a change to the order of and whitespace between the attributes and namespace declarations on the outermost <TEI> element. Nothing else. Should cause no appreciable change at all. But requires different expected results, as the order is propegated through to the output.

	Revert testPure1: Revert the testPure1.odd file in preparation for re-introducing each change I made one at a time.

2018-11-23  martindholmes  <mholmes@uvic.ca>

	Removing -Dregenerate support, since it's risky and not the ideal approach.

2018-11-23  Syd Bauman  <s.bauman@neu.edu>

2018-11-20  Syd Bauman  <s.bauman@neu.edu>

	Updated AUTHORS: Added those who are listed in ChangeLog or have > 25 commits to the AUTHORS list.

2018-11-19  Syd Bauman  <s.bauman@neu.edu>

	Fix #334: During today's Stylesheets group conference call we fixed ticket #334 by adding a template that simply ingores <cb>, <gb>, and <milestone> elements. It is possible, if not outright likely, that in the future we will have to do better than just ignoring them, but at least now FO can be produced w/o this error forcing the build to fail.
