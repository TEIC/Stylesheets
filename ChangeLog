2018-01-31  Syd Bauman  <s.bauman@neu.edu>

	Address #253: With Stylesheets sub-group of Council, removed "(unknown project)" as the defalut value for the  parameter, and replace with the first available distributor, publisher, or authority in that order; if none available, assign nil to value (which has to be tested for, but that's what the Stylesheets already do).

2018-01-30  martindholmes  <mholmes@uvic.ca>

	Adding a conditional to check whether there's any useful value in the $institution param before creating a block for it, on issue #253.

	bug fix: return only 1 prefix
	On line 2403 we try to set the context node to the identifiable
	element that has the `@ident` that matches the `@key` or `@name` of
	the element tei:generateRefPrefix() as context, by using
	`<xsl:for-each select="key('IDENTS',$lookup)">`. HOWEVER, it is
	possible that there will be more than one element in IDENTS with the
	same `@ident`. (E.g., this happens when the TEI-in-Libraries Best
	Practices documentation is generated, because each of the 4 included
	ODD files (level1.odd, level2.odd, level3.odd, level4.odd) has a
	<specGrpRef> that points to a set of ODD elements in lib-header.odd.
	This those particularly identifiable elements occur more than once in
	IDENTS, and the `@ident` of one of them as a key would return 4 items.
	This also might happen when elements of the same name occur in
	different modules, which TEI itself does not do but another language
	being defined in ODD might.) Thus the <xsl:for-each>, which I think
	the original author intended to do nothing but set the context node,
	ends up iterating multiple times, and we try to return multiple items,
	when we are only allowed to return one.

	To fix this, or at least to hack around it, I have changed the line in
	question to read `<xsl:for-each select="key('IDENTS',$lookup)[1]">`,
	thus selecting only the first element found in IDENTS with the
	`@ident` of interest.

	This may not be the ideal fix, but it is working for the case
	intended, and has not (yet) broken anything else.

	Expected results again.

	Expected results again.

	Newline missing from end of file in expected-results.

	Fix for error in column count attribute when processing deprecation on elementSpec. Part of work on https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/205, although this has much broader consequences and gives rise to a hitherto undetected error in Guidelines output.

	Changing expected results for FO test output.

	Previous commit had a bug. Correcting it.

	Working on TEIC/Stylesheets#205, added a workaround to catch cases where an attempt is made to create an internal link with no target or no linking text, as triggered during FO building by TEIC/Stylesheets#203.

	Fix for first bug that shows up in odd-to-lite-to-fo processing being tracked at TEIC/Stylesheets#205. The code did not allow for embedded tables; the fix is to look only at the first ancestor table of the context element, not the sequence of all of them.

	ODD->DTD process now handles @minOccurs and @maxOccurs properly as numbers. Also put parens around even singleton parameter entity references that are in a series.

	Condense various places where I was converting @minOccurs and @maxOccurs to a single (NOT\!) function. It's not a single function because, for reasons I do not understand, odd2odd.xsl does not import teiodds.xsl. Thus the function is duplicated in that file.

	Found that some cells in an Excel spreadsheet were losing some or all of their content. Upon investigating found that problem only occured when the <si> referred to in the xl/sharedStrings.xml file had <r> children, not just a single <t> child. Found the template that handles those <si> elements, and found that if there were any <r> children, it was only processing <r> those that themselves had <rPr> children. I.e., si/r[rPr] were being processed, but si/r[not(rPr)] were not. Now, I don't know what <si>, <t>, <r>, or <rPr> mean, but processing all the <r> children rather than just those that themselves have <rPr> children solved my problem.
