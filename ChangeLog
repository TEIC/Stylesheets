	Updated P5 subset: Initially with @trishaoconnor, updated p5subset to current version from TEI dev branch. This required reverting commit 61247e54d5412e5f1a2e46adb76ef92879c66b3a from TEI issue 2498, PR 2520, and lots of work, including discussion at SVF2F.

	Work on #319 point 2: @trishaoconnor and I found (what we think is) the spot in odd2odd.xsl that caused the output constraintSpec element to appear before the output datatype element, and swapped it with the immediately following constructor in the "odd2odd-mergeAttribute" template. This fixed the error in the output of running odd2odd.xsl on tei_simplePrint.odd, and all tests in both Test/ and Test2/ pass (except I do not have xelatex on my system).

	Minor fixes, and changes to tests to match: 2) Fix typo — function had "#teitodocx" where it meant "#docxtotei"

	Convert commented-out debugging code to useful comment.

2023-10-09  Syd Bauman  <s.bauman@northeastern.edu>

	Various minor things:  * Removed some debugging code  * Added tests (in Test2/testPure1) for sequence/@m[ia][nx]Occurs and alternate/@m[ia][nx]Occurs, including valid instance, but not invalid  * Updated tests (in Test/)

2023-10-08  Syd Bauman  <s.bauman@northeastern.edu>

	Now have @minOccurs and @maxOccurs working on <sequence> (and thus <interleave>), too. Passes tests, so *may* be eligible to merge into dev, but not really ready, yet, as need to work on repeatability of <alternate>.

	Still NOT ready to be merged into dev: In this commit I intended to comment out some debugging code (which renders output kinda useless, is it sticks the results of each pass into the output as RELAXNG <div> elements, rather than as comments) and update some tests. But I found to my horror that (despite message of previous 3 commits) tests were not passing. So lots of test updates, too. NB: One of the things that makes this ineligible for merging into dev is that the constraint for the <choice> element has changed from the incorrect, but workable '( model.choicePart | choice )+' to the incorrect and *not* workable '( model.choicePart | choice )+'. At the moment I have no idea why, but it does not really matter, as attacking minOccurs= and maxOccurs= on <alternate> and <sequence> is next.

	Add a test with 2 <anyElement> elements.

2023-10-07  Syd Bauman  <s.bauman@northeastern.edu>

	Code for supporting minOccurs= and maxOccurs= on <anyElement>, mostly untested because of #631. This comit is *not* ready for prime time.

	remove some debugging code

	Fix #631 (I hope): Generate a different RELAX NG pattern (and reference to it) for every occurence of an anyElement element, and update tests to match. (Previously we were trying to generate one for every content model in which an anyElement occurred, but were generation one for every content model in which an anyElement element occurred only once.)

2023-10-04  Benjamin W. Bohl  <bohl@edirom.de>

	Update odd2odd.xsl

2023-10-01  Syd Bauman  <s.bauman@northeastern.edu>

	Replace tei:minOmaxO() and both tei:generateIndicators() functions (one for RELAXNG, one for DTD) with a new function, tei:norMinMax(); should be no change to output; passes both Test/ and Test2/.

2023-09-30  Syd Bauman  <s.bauman@northeastern.edu>

	Allow the `<ref>` elements to get processed: Stylesheets group, with big thanks to @hcayless, realized a) these things (contents of `<hi>` in intermediate Lite stage that contain the `<ref>`s that were not working) were being processed with `<value-of>`, not `<apply-templates>`; and b) furthermore, the templates for `<ref>` would have been processed if these templates for `<hi>` did not exist, and since all they were doing in 2 of 3 cases was adding boldface we did not like (and failing to process the `<ref>`s), we just nuked 2 of them and fixed the 3rd (which also adds the pointy brackets for element names).

Turns out it was not documented to be passed to ant by that command, but was being passed; however, the ant buildhtml target was ignoring it. This is a fix for both of those problems (transformtei not correctly documenting switch, teianttasks.xml not passing switch to stylesheets).

	Revert re-naming of examples files: I had temporarily renamed the examples files for debugging purposes. Lo and behold it helped us find another bug (see TEI #2070), but is no longer needed.

	Address #478

	Fix: Move template for <teix:egXML> from html_oddprocessing to html_tagdocs. This fixes the problem found in Test2/ in which <teix:egXML> elements were being completely dropped, and does not seem to change the results of the Guidelines build at all (i.e., that still works and gives proper anchors in all <teix:egXML>s).

2020-06-01  Syd Bauman  <s.bauman@neu.edu>

	Try to fix build: I am not sure, but I think this commit simply reverses a recent one. We are caught in dev-vs-current cycle, here. With this commit, I believe that Stylesheets_dev against P5_dev should pass the tests; however, Stylesheets_dev aaginst P5_released (current) will not (with a diff error in test.rng due to changes to lexicographic attrs). I am not sure what, if anything, could be done to get both to pass simultaneously.

2019-01-20  raffazizzi  <raffaeleviglianti@gmail.com>

	Adjusted odd2json to look for class types from a source file when not found in the local ODD. This will help supporting non-compiled ODDs. Updated tests.

2019-01-12  Peter Stadler  <stadlerpeter@yahoo.fr>

	Adding a readme to document the ODD file processing.

2018-12-08  Syd Bauman  <s.bauman@neu.edu>

	Update testPure1, step 7: Add tests for <dataRef> with key= or name=, and restriction=. Note that one of these tests worked, in that it found a Stylesheets problem. See #349.

	Update testPure1, step 6: 1) Delete att.lexicographic instead of att.deprecated, just to be clear that we are testing the deletion of something that is not included. (Since previous versions of this schema have included 'tagdocs', and even this version sucks in some elements therefrom.) 2) Change the alteration of synch= to be a deletion thereof to match the comment. I.e., synch= should not be included in output schemas, and thus invalid.

2018-12-07  Syd Bauman  <s.bauman@neu.edu>

	Update testPure1, step 5: Delete the <join> and <joinGrp> elements from testPure1 schema using <elementSpec>.

	Update testPure1, step 4: Replace reference to module 'tagdocs' and replace with references to elements <gi>, <att>, and <val>. Add a test to ensure that <tag> is invalid.

	Update testPure1, step 3: Move reference to module 'linking' from middle-of-pack to up where all the other simple <moduleRef>s are. This has profound effects on what the output RNG looks like, but should have no effect on what it validates. I have checked against all the XML files in the inputFiles/ directory, and the same number of error messages are issued for each.

	Update testPure1, step 2: Change order of <moduleRef> declarations so that those that are simple (i.e., have no attrs) come first. This has profound effects on what the output RNG looks like, but should have no effect on what it validates. I have checked against all the XML files in the imnputFiles/ directory, and the same number of error messages are issued for each. Also use phrase-level encoding in the <desc>.

	Update testPure1, step 1: Just a change to the order of and whitespace between the attributes and namespace declarations on the outermost <TEI> element. Nothing else. Should cause no appreciable change at all. But requires different expected results, as the order is propegated through to the output.

	Revert testPure1: Revert the testPure1.odd file in preparation for re-introducing each change I made one at a time.

2018-11-23  martindholmes  <mholmes@uvic.ca>

	Removing -Dregenerate support, since it's risky and not the ideal approach.

2018-11-19  Syd Bauman  <s.bauman@neu.edu>

	Fix #334: During today's Stylesheets group conference call we fixed ticket #334 by adding a template that simply ingores <cb>, <gb>, and <milestone> elements. It is possible, if not outright likely, that in the future we will have to do better than just ignoring them, but at least now FO can be produced w/o this error forcing the build to fail.
