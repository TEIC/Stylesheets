                        <T TITLE>EPISTLE
              To all good Fellowes, Professors of
               %the Gentle Craft; of what degree%
                             soever.

<T PROSE>Kinde Gentlemen, and honest boone Companions, I present you
here with a merrie conceited Comedie, called, %the Shoemakers%
%Holyday%, acted by my Lorde Admiralls Players this present
Christmasse, before the Queenes most excellent Majestie. For the
mirth and plesant matter, by her Highnesse graciously accepted;
being indeed no way offensive. The Argument of the play I will
set downe in this Epistle: Sir %Hugh Lacie% Earle of %Lincolne%, had a
yong Gentleman of his owne name, his nere kinsman, that loved
the Lorde Maiors daughter of London; to prevent and crosse which
love, the Earle caused his kinsman to be sent Coronell of com-+
panie into France: who resigned his place to another gentleman his
friend, and came disguised like a Dutch Shoomaker, to the house
of %Symon Eyre% in Tower streete, who served the Maior and his
household with shooes. The merriments that passed in Eyres house, his
comming to be Maior of %London, Lacies% getting his love, and other
accidents; with two merry Three-mens songs. Take all in good 
worth that is well intended, for nothing is purposed bu mirth,
mirht lengthneth long life; which, with all other blessings I heartily
wish you.

                               Farewell.

O the month of Maie, the merrie month of Maie,
So frolicke, so gay, and so greene, so greene, so greene:
O and then did I, unto my true love say,
Sweete Peg, thou shalt be my Summers Queene.

Now the Nightingale, the prettie Nightingale,
The sweetest singer in all the Forrests quiet:
Intreates thee sweete Peggie, to heare thy true loves tale,
Loe, yonder she sitteth, her breast against a brier.

But O I spie the Cuckoo, the Cuckoo, the Cuckoo,
See where she sitteth, come away my joy:
Come away I prithee, I do not like the Cuckoo   
Should sing where my Peggie and I kisse and toy.

    O the month of Maie, the merrie month of Maie,
    So frolike, so gay, and so greene, so greene, so greene:
    And then did I, unto my true love say,
    Sweete Peg, thou shalt be my Summers Queene.

<T SONG>Cold's wind, and wet's the raine,
  Saint Hugh be our good speede:
Ill is the weather that bringeth no gaine.
  Nor helpes good hearts in neede.

Trowle the boll, the jolly Nut-browne boll,
  And here kind mate to thee:
Let's sing a dirge for Saint Hughes soule,
  And downe it merrily.

Downe a downe, hey downe a downe,
  Hey derie derie down a down, <T SDP>%Close with the tenor boy.%
<T SONG>Ho well done, to me let come,
  Ring compasse gentle joy.

Trowle the boll, the Nut-browne boll,
  And here kind etc. %as often as there be men to drinke.%
%At last when all have drunke, this verse.%

Cold's the wind, and wet's the raine,

  Nor helpes good hearts in neede.

                            before the Queenes
                                 Majestie.

<T VERSE>As wretches in a storme (expecting day)
With trembling hands and eyes cast up to heaven,
Make Prayers the anchor of their conquerd hopes,
So we (deere Goddesse) wonder of all eyes,
Your meanest vassalls (through mistrust and feare,
To sincke into the bottome of disgrace,
By our imperfit pastimes) prostrate thus
On bended knees, our sailes of hope do strike,
Dreading the bitter stormes of your dislike.
Since then (unhappy men) our hap is such,
That to our selves our selves no help can bring,
But needes must perish, if your saint-like eares
(Locking the temple where all mercy sits)
Refuse the tribute of our begging tongues.
Oh graunt (bright mirror of true Chastitie)
From those life-breathing starres your sun-like eyes,
One gratious smile: for your celestiall breath
Must send us life, or sentence us to death.

                   <T SDD>%Enter% LORD MAYOR, LINCOLN.

<T VERSE><S LINCOLN.> My Lord Maior, you have sundrie times
Feasted my selfe, and many Courtiers more,
Seldome, or never can we be so kind,
To make requtall or your curtesie:
But leaving this, I heare my cosen Lacie
Is much affected to your daughter Rose.
<S LORD MAYOR.> True my good Lord, and she loves him so wel,
That I mislike her boldnesse in the chace.
<S LINCOLN.> Why lord Maior, think you it then a shame,
To joyne a Lacie with an Otleys name?
<S LORD MAYOR.> Too meane is my poore girle for his high birth,
Poore Cittizens must not with Courtiers wed,
Who will in silkes, and gay apparrell spend
More in one yeare, then I am worth by farre,
Therefore your honour neede not doubt my girle.
<S LINCOLN.> Take heede my Lord, advise you what you do,
A verier unthrift lives not in the world,
Then is my cosen, for Ile tel you what,
Tis now almost a yeare since he requested
To travell countries for experience,
I furnisht him with coyne, billes of exchange,
Letters of credite, men to waite on him,
Solicited my friends in Italie
Well to repect him: but to see the end:
Scant had he jornied through halfe Germanie,
But all his coyne was spent, his men cast off,
His billes imbezeld, and my jolly coze, 
Asham'd to shew his bankerupt presence here,
Became a Shoomker in Wittenberg,
A goodly science for a gentleman
Of such discent: now judge the rest by this.
Suppose your daughter have a thousnd pound,
He did consume me more in one halfe yeare,
And make him heyre to all the wealthe you heve,
One twelve moneth's rioting wil waste it all,
Then seeke (my Lord) some honest Cittizen
To wed your duaghter to.
<S LORD MAYOR.> I thanke your Lordhsip,
<T SDP><%Aside%> Wel Foxe, I understand your subtiltie,
<T SDP><%Aloud%> As for yor nephew, let your lordhsips eie
But watch his actions, and you neede not feare,
For I have sent my duather farre enough,
And yet your cosen Rowland might do well
Now he ahath learn'd an occupation,
<T SDP><%Aside%> And yet I scorne to call him sonne in law.
<S LINCOLN.> I but I have a better trade for him,
I thanke his grace he hath appointed him,
Chiefe colonell of all those companies
Mustred in London, and the shires about,
To serve his highnesse in those warres of France:
See where he comes: Lovel what newes with you?

<T SDD>%Enter% LOVELL, LACY, %and% ASKEW.

<T VERSE><S LOVELL.> My Lord of Lincolne, tis his highnesse will,
That presently your cosen ship for France
With all his powers, he would not for a million,
But they should land at Deepe within foure daies.
<S LINCOLN.> Goe certifie his grace it shall be done.
                                               <T SDE>%Exit% LOVELL.
<T VERSE> Now cosen Lacie, in what forwardnesse
Are all your companies?
<S LACY.> All wel prepar'd,
The men of Hartfordshire lie at Mile end,
Suffolke, and Essex, traine in Tuttle fields,
The Londoners, and those of Middlesex,
All gallantly prepar'd in Finsbury,
With Frolike spirits, long for their parting hower.
<S LORD MAYOR.> They have their imprest, coates, and furniture,
And if it please your cosen Lacie ccome
To the Guild Hall, he shall receive his pay,
And twentie pounds besides my bretheren
Will freely give him, to approve our loves
We beare unto my Lord your uncle here.
<S LACY.> I thanke your honour.
<S LINCOLN.> Thankes my good Lord Maior.
<S LORD MAYOR.> At the Guild Hall we wil expect your comming.

                                                           <T SDE>%Exit%.

<T VERSE><S LINCOLN.> To approve your loves to me? no, subtiltie!
Nephew, that twentie pound he doth bestow,
For joy to rid you from his daughter Rose:
But cosens both, now here are none but friends,
I would not have you cast an amourous eie
Upon so meane a project, as the love
Of a gay wanton painted cittizen,
I know this churle, even in the height of scorne,
Doth hate the mixture of his bloud with thine,
I pray thee do thou so, remember coze,
What honourable fortunes wayt on thee,
Increase the kings love which so brightly shines,
And gilds thy hopes, I have no heire but thee:
And yet not thee, if with a wayward spirit,
Thou start from the true byas of my love.
<S LACY.> My Lord, I will (for honor (not desire
Of land or livings) or to be your heire)
So guide my actions in pursuit of France,
As shall adde glorie to the Lacies name.
<S LINCOLN.> Coze, for those words heres thirtie Protugues
And Nepheew Askew, there's a few for you,
Faire honour in her loftiest eminence
Staies in France for you till you fetch her thence,
Then Nephewes, clap swift wings on your dissignes,
Be gone, be gone, make haste to the Guild Hall,
There presently Ile meete you, do not stay,
Where honour becons, shame attends delay.
                                                           <T SDE>%Exit%.
<T PROSE><S ASKEW.> How gladly would your uncle have you gone?
<T VERSE><S LACY.> True coze, but Ile ore-reach his policies,
I have some serious buinesse for three dayes,
Which nothing but my presence can dispatch,
You therefore cosen with the companies
Shall haste to dober, there Ile meete with you,
Or if I stay past my prefixed time,
Away for France, weele meete in Normandie,
The twentie pounds my Lord Maior gives to me
You shall receive, and these ten protugues,
Part of mine uncles thirtie, gentle cose,
Have care to our great charge, I know your wisedome
Hath tride it selfe in higher consequence.
<S ASKEW.> Coze, al my selfe am yours, yet have this care,
To lodge in London with al secresie,
Our uncle Lincolne hath (besides his owne)
Many a jealous eie, that in your face
Stares onely to watch meanes for your disgrace.
<S LACY.> Stay cosen, who be these?

woman, if you take her husband away from her a night, you
undoo her, she may beg in the day time, for hees as good a work-+

<S JANE.> O let him stay, else I sal be undone.
<S FIRKE.> I truly, she shal be laid at one side like a paire of old shooes
else, and be occupied for no use.
<T VERSE><S LACY.> Truly my friends, it lies not in my power,
The Londoners are prest, paide, and set forth
By the Lord Maior, I cannot change a man.
<T PROSE><S HODGE.> Why then you were as good be a corporall, as a colonel,
if you cannot discharge one good fellow, and I tell you true, I
thinke you doe more then you can answere, to presse a man
within a yeare and a day of his mariage.
<S EYRE.> Wel said melancholy Hodge, gramercy my fine foreman.
<S MARGERY.> Truly gentlemen, it were il done, for such as you, to
stand so stiffely against a poore young wife: considering her
case, she is new married, but let that passe: I pray deale not
roughly with her, her husband is a yong man and but newly
entred, but let that passe.
<S EYRE.> Away with your pisherie pasherie, your pols and yoru

Rafe.
<S HODGE.> Raph, thart a gull by this hand, and thou goest not.
<T VERSE><S ASKEW.> I am glad (good master Ayre) it is my hap
To meete so resolute a souldiour.
Trust me, for your report, and love to him,
A common slight regard shall not respect him.
<T PROSE><S LACY.> Is thy name Raph?
<S RAFE.> Yes sir.
<T VERSE><S LACY.> Give me thy hand,
Thou shalt not want, as I am a gentleman:
Woman, be patient, God (no doubt) wil send
Thy husband safe againe, but he must go,
His countries quarrel sayes, it shall be so.

He sets more discord in a noble house,
By one daies broching of his pickethanke tales,
Then can be salv'd againe in twentie yeares,
And he (I feare) shall go with us to France,
To prie into our actions.

Ludgate, fight my fine boy.
<S FIRKE.> Here Rafe, here's three two pences, two carry into France,

<S HODGE.> Raph, I am heavy at parting, but heres a shilling for
thee, God send thee to cramme thy slops with French crownes,
and thy enemies bellies with bullets.
<T VERSE><S RAFE.> I thanke you maister, and I thanke you all:
Now gentle wife, my loving lovely Jane,
Rich men at parting, give their wives rich gifts,
Jewels and rings, to grace their lillie hands,
Thou know'st our trade makes rings for womens heeles:
Here take this paire of shooes cut out by Hodge,
Stricht by my fellow firke, seam'd by my selfe,
Made up and pinckt, with letters for thy name,
Weare them my deere Jane, for thy husbands sake,
And everie morning when thou pull'st them on,
Remeber me, and pray for my returne,
Make much of them, for I have made them so,
That I can know them from a thousand mo.

As the sweete countnaunce of my Lacy doth.

Why lowrde you so at my nativity,
To make me love, yet live rodb of my love?

Frigbottom by Doctors Commons, doe all (by my troth) send

sowre as verjuice: goe thy wayes thought I, thou maist be much
in my gaskins, but nothing in my neatherstockes: this is your
fault mistris, to love him that loves not you, he thinkes scorne
to do as he's done to, but if I were as you, Ide cry, go by Ieronimo,

<T VERSE>Ide set mine olde debts against my new driblets,
And the hares foot against the goose giblets,
For if ever I sigh when sleepe I shoulde take,
Pray God I may loose my mayden-head when I wake.

That thus disguisde, I may unknowne possesse,

For her have I forsooke my charge in France,
Incurd the Kings displeasure, and stird up
Rough hatred in mine uncle Lincolnes brest:
O love, how powerfull art thou, that canst change
High birth to basenesse, and a noble mind,
To the meane semblance of a shooemaker?
But thus it must be: for her cruell father,
Hating the single union of our soules,
Hath secretly conveyed my Rose from London,
To barre me of her presence, but I trust
Fortune and this disguise will furder me
Once more to view her beautie, gaine her sight.
Here in Towerstreete, with Ayre the shooe-maker,
Meane I a while to worke, I know the trade,

Then cheere thy hoping sprites, be not dismaide,
Thou canst not want, do fortune what she can,

To crowne his giddie browes with ample honors,
Send him cheese Colonell, and all my hope
Thus to be dasht? but tis in vaine to grieve,

Upon my life I have found out his plot,
That old dog Love that fawnd upon him so,
Love to that puling girle, his faire cheek't Rose
The Lord Maiors daughter, hath distracted him,
And in the fire of that loves lunacie,
Hath he burnt up himselfe, consum'd his credite,
Lost the kings love, yea and I feare, his life,
Onely to get a wanton to his wife:
Dodger, it is so.
<S DODGER.> I feare so, my good Lord.
<S LINCOLN.> It is so, nay sure it cannot be,
I am at my wits end. Dodger_
<S DODGER.> Yea my Lord.

Spend this gold for thy paines, goe seeke him out,
Watch at my Lord Maiors (there if he live)

Prethee be diligent. Lacie thy name
Liv'd once in honour, now dead in shame:
Be circumspect.

Misconstrue not my words, nor misconceive
Of my affection, whose devoted soule
Sweares that I love thee dearer then my heart.
<S ROSE.> As deare as your owne heart? I judge it right.
Men love their hearts best when th'are out of sight.
<S HAMMON.> I love you, by this hand.
<S ROSE.> Yet hands off now:
If flesh be fraile, how weake and frail's your vowe?
<S HAMMON.> Then by my life I sweare.
<S ROSE.> Then do not brawle,
One quarrell looseth wife and life and all,
Is not your meaning thus?
<S HAMMON.> In faith you jest.
<S ROSE.> Love loves to sport, therfore leave love y'are best.

<S HAMMON.> Sweet Rose, be not so strange in fansying me,
Nay never turne aside, shunne not my sight,
I am not growne so fond, to fond my love
On any that shall quit it with disdaine,
If you wil love me, so, if not, farewell.

Tis farre more blessed then to be a wife.

With lovely ladie mistris of my heart,
Pardon your servant, and the rimer play,

Or shal I undertake some martiall spoile,
Wearing your glove at turney, and at tilt,
And tel how many gallants I unhorst,
Sweete, wil this pleasure you?
<S ROSE.> Yea, when wilt begin?
What, loverimes man? fie on that deadly sinne.
<S LORD MAYOR.> If you wil have her, Ile make her agree.
<S HAMMON.> Enforced love is worse then hate to me,
There is a wench keepes shop in the old change,
To her wil I, it is not wealth I seeke,
I have enough, and wil preferre her love
Before the world: my good lord Maior adew,
Olde love for me, I have no lucke with new.

<T VERSE><S HAMMON.> All this I hope is but a womans fray,
That means, come to me, when she cries, away:
In earnest mistris I do not jest,
A true chaste love hath entred in my brest,
I love you dearely as I love my life,
I love you as a husband loves a wife.
That, and no other love my love requires,
Thy wealth I know is little, my desires
Thirst not for gold, sweete beauteous Jane whats mine,
Shall (if thou make my selfe thine) all be thine,
Say, judge, what is thy sentence, life, or death?
Mercie or crueltie lies in thy breath.
<S JANE.> Good sir, I do beleeve you love me well:
For tis a seely conquest, seely pride,
For one like you (I meane a gentlman)
To boast, that by his love tricks he hath brought,
Such and such women to his amorous lure:
I thinke you do not so, yet many doe,
And make it even a very trade to wooe,
I could be coy, as many women be,
Feede you with sunne-shine smiles, and wanton lookes,
But I detest withcraft, say that I
Doe constantly beleeve you constant have_
<S HAMMON.> Why dost thou not beleeve me?
<S JANE.> I beleeve you,
But yet good sir, because I will not greeve you,
With hopes to taste fruit, which will never fall,
In simple truth this is the summe of all,
My husband lives, at least I hope he lives,
Prest was he to these bitter warres in France,
Bitter they are to me by wanting him,
I have but one heart, and that hearts his due,
How can I then bestow the same on you?
Whilst he lives, his I live, be it nere so poore,
And rather be his wife, then a kings whore.
<S HAMMON.> Chaste and deare woman, I will not abuse thee,
Although it cost my life, if thou refuse me,
Thy husband prest for France, what was his name?
<S JANE.> Rafe Damport.
<S HAMMON.> Damport, heres a letter sent
From France to me, from a deare friend of mine,
A gentleman of place, here he doth write,
Their names that have bin slaine in every fight.
<S JANE.> I hope deaths scroll containes not my loves name.
<S HAMMON.> Cannot you reade?
<S JANE.> I can.
<S HAMMON.> Persue the same,
To my remembrance such a name I read
Amongst the rest: see here.
<S JANE.> Aye me, hees dead:
Hees dead, if this be true my deare hearts slaine.
<S HAMMON.> Have patience, deare love.
<S JANE.> Hence, hence.
<S HAMMON.> Nay sweete Jane,
Make not poore sorrow prowd with these rich teares,
I mourne thy husbands death because thou mournst.
<S JANE.> That bil is forgde, tis signde by forgerie.
<S HAMMON.> Ile bring thee letters sent besides to many
Carrying the like report: Jane tis too true,
Come, weepe not: mourning though it rise from love
Helpes not the mourned, yet hurtes them that mourne.
<S JANE.> For Gods sake leave me.
<S HAMMON.> Whither dost thou turne?
Forget the deade, love them that are alive,
His love is faded, trie how mine wil thrive.
<S JANE.> Tis now no time for me to thinke on love.
<S HAMMON.> Tis now best time for you to thinke on love, be-
cause your love lives not.
<S JANE.> Thogh he be dead, my love to him shal not be buried:
For Gods sake leave me to my selfe alone.
<S HAMMON.> Twould kil my soule to leave thee drownd in mone:
Answere me to my sute, and I am gone,
Say to me, yea, or no.
<S JANE.> No.
<S HAMMON.> Then farewell, one farewel wil not serve, I come
again, come drie these wet cheekes, tel me faith sweet Jane, yea,
or no, once more.
<S JANE.> Once more I say no, once more be gone I pray, else wil I

<S HAMMON.> Nay then I wil grow rude by this white hand,
Until you change that colde no, here ile stand,
Til by your hard heart_
<S JANE.> Nay, for Gods love peace,
My sorrowes by your presence more increase,
Not that you thus are present, but al griefe
Desires to be alone, therefore in briefe
Thus much I say, and saying bid adew,
If ever I wed man it shall be you.
<S HAMMON.> Oh blessed voyce, deare Jane Ile urge no more,
Thy breath hath made me rich.

Majestie, let car vanish, cast it uppon thy Nobles, it will make
thee looke alwayes young like Apollo, and crye humpe: Prince
am I none, yet am I princely borne.
<S KING.> Ha ha: saye Cornewall, didst thou ever see his like?
<S CORNWALL.> Not I, my lorde.

<T SDD>%Enter% LINCOLN, %and <former>% LORD MAYOR.

<T VERSE><S KING.> Lincolne, what newes with you?
<S LINCOLN.> My gracious Lord, have care unto your selfe,
For there are traytors here.
<S ALL.> Traytors, where? who?
<S EYRE.> Traitors in my house? God forbid, where be my officers?
Ile spend my soule ere my king feele harme.
<S KING.> Where is the traytor, Lincolne?
<S LINCOLN.> Here he stands.
<S KING.> Cornewall, lay hold Lacie: Lincolne, speake:
What canst thou lay unto thy Nephewes charge?
<S LINCOLN.> This my deere liege: your grace to doe me honour,
Heapt on the head of this degenerous boy,
Desertlesse favours, you made choise of him,
To be commander over powers in France,
But he_
<S KING.> Good Lincolne prythee pawse a while,
Even in thine eies I reade what thou wouldst speake,
I know how Lacie did neglect our love,
Ranne himselfe deepely (in the highest degree)
Into vile treason.
<S LINCOLN.> Is he not a traytor?
<S KING.> Lincolne, he was: now have we pardned him,
Twas not a base want of true valors fire,
That held him out of France, but loves desire.
<S LINCOLN.> I wil not beare his shame upon my backe.
<S KING.> Nor shalt thou Lincolne, I forgive you both.
<S LINCOLN.> Then (good my liege) forbid the boy to wed
One, whose meane birth will much disgrace his bed.
<S KING.> Are they not married?
<S LINCOLN.> No my Liege.
<S BOTH.> We are.
<S KING.> Shall I divorce them then? O be it farre,
That any hand on earth should dare untie,
The sacred knot knit by Gods majestie,
I would not for my crown disjoyne their hands,
That are conjoynd in holy nuptiall bands,
How saist thou Lacy? wouldst thou loose thy Rose?
<S LACY.> Not for all Indias wealth, my soveraigne.
<S KING.> But Rose I am sure her Lacie would forgoe.
<S ROSE.> If Rose were askt that question, sheed say, no.
<S KING.> You heare them Lincolne.
<S LINCOLN.> Yea my liege, I do.
<S KING.> Yet canst thou find ith heart to part these two?
Who seeks, besides you, to divource these lovers?
<S LORD MAYOR.> I do (my gracious Lord) I am her father.
<S KING.> Sir Roger Oteley, our last Maior I thinke?
<S NOBLEMAN.> The same my liege.
<S KING.> Would you offend Loves lawes?
Wel, you shal have your wills, you sue to me,
To prohibite the match: Soft, let me see,
You both are married, Lacie, art thou not?
<S LACY.> I am, dread Soveraigne.
<S KING.> Then upon thy life,
I charge thee, not to call this woman wife.
<S LORD MAYOR.> I thanke your grace.
<S ROSE.> O my most gratious Lord!
                                                    <T SDP>%Kneele%.
<T VERSE><S KING.> Nay Rose, never wooe me, I tel you true,
Although as yet I am a batchellor,
Yet I beleeve I shal not marry you.
<S ROSE.> Can you divide the body from the soule,
Yet make the body live?
<S KING.> Yea, so profound?
I cannot Rose, but you I must divide:
Faire maide, this bridegroome cannot be your bride.
Are you pleasde Lincolne? Oteley, are you pleasde?
<S BOTH.> Yes my Lord.
<S KING.> Then must my heart be easde,
For credit me, my conscience lives in paine,
Til these whom I devorcde by joynd againe:
Lacy, give me thy hand, Rose, lend me thine.
Be what you would be: kisse now: so, thats fine,
At night (lovers to bed: now let me see,
Which of you all mislikes this harmony?
<S LORD MAYOR.> Wil you then take from me my child perforce?
<S KING.> Why tell me Oteley, shines not Lacies name,
As bright in the worldes eye, as the gay beames
Of any citizen?
<S LINCOLN.> Yea but my gratious Lord,
I do mislike the match farre more than he,
Her bloud is too too base.
<S KING.> Lincolne, no more,
Dost thou not know, that love respects no bloud?
Cares not for difference of birth, or state,
The maide is yong, wel borne, faire, vertuous,
A worthy bride for any gentleman:
Besides, your nephew for her sake did stoope
To bare necessitie: and as I heare,
Forgetting honors, and all courtly pleasures,
To gaine her love, became a shoomaker.
As for the honor which he lost in France,
Thus I redeeme It: Lacie, kneele thee downe,
Arise sir Rowland Lacie: tell me now,
Tell me in earnest Oteley, canst thou chide,
Seeing thy Rose a ladie and a bryde?
<S LORD MAYOR.> I am content with what your Grace hath done.
<S LINCOLN.> And I my liege, since theres no remedie.
<S KING.> Come on then, al shake hands, Ile have you frends,
Where there is much love, all discord ends,
What sayes my mad Lord Maior to all this love?
<T PROSE><S EYRE.> O my liege, this honour you have done to my fine
journeyman here, Rowland Lacie, and all these favours which
you have showne to me this daye in my poore house, will make
Simon Eyre live longer by one dozen of warme summers more
then he should.
<T VERSE><S KING.> Nay, my mad Lord Maior (that shall be thy name)
If any grace of mine cn length thy life,   
One honour more Ile doe thee, that new building,
Which at thy cost in Cornehill is erected,
Shall take a name from us, weele have it cald,
The Leaden hall, because in digging it,
You found the lead that covereth the same.
<S EYRE.> I thanke your Majestie.
<S MARGERY.> God blesse your Grace.
<S KING.> Lincolne, a word with you.

<T SDD>%Enter% HODGE, RAFE, %and more% SHOEMAKERS.

<T PROSE><S EYRE.> How now my mad knaves? Peace, speake softly, yonder
is the king.
<T VERSE><S KING.> With the olde troupe which there we keepe in pay,
We wil incorporate a new supply:
Before one summer more passe ore my head,
France shal repent England was injured,
What are all those?
<S LACY.> All shoomakers, my Liege,
Sometimes my fellowes, in their companies
I livde as merry as an emperor.
<S KING.> My mad lord Mayor, are all these shoomakers?
<S EYRE.> All Shooemakers, my Liege, all gentlemen of the Gentle
Craft, true Trojans, couragious Cordwainers, they all kneele
to the shrine of holy saint Hugh.
<S ALL.> God save your majesty. All shoomakers.
<S KING.> Mad Simon, would they any thing with us?
<T PROSE><S EYRE.> Mum mad knaves, not a word, Ile doot, I warrant you. 
They are all beggars, my Liege, all for themselves: and I for them
all, on both my knees do intreate, that for the honor of poore
Simon Eyre, and the good of his brethren these mad knaves, your
Grace would vouchsafe some privilege to my new Leden hall,
that it may be lawfull for us to buy and sell leather there two
dayes a weeke.
<T VERSE><S KING.> Mad Sim, I grant your suite, you shall have patent
To hold two market dayes in Leden hall,
Mondayes and Fridayes, those shal be the times:
Will this content you?
<T PROSE><S ALL.> Jesus blesse your Grace.
<S EYRE.> In the name of these my poore brethren shoomakers, I
most humbly thanke your Grace. But before I rise, seeing you
are in the Giving vaine, and we in the Begging, graunt Sim
Eyre one boone more.
<S KING.> What is it my Lord Maior?
<S EYRE.> Vouchsafe to taste of a poore banquet that standes sweetely
waiting for your sweete presence.
<T VERSE><S KING.> I shall undo thee Eyre, only with feasts,
Already have I beene too troublesome,
Say, have I not?
<T PROSE><S EYRE.> O my deere king, Sim Eyre was taken unawares upon a day
of shroving which I promist long ago to the prentises of London:
for andt please your Highnes, in time past
<T VERSE>I bare the water tankerd, and my coate
Sits not a whit the worse upon my backe:
And then upon a morning some mad boyes,
It was Shrovetuesday even as tis now,
<T PROSE>Gave me my breakfast, and I swore then by the stopple of my
tankerd, if ever I came to be Lord Maior of London, I would
feast al the prentises. This day (my liege) I did it, and the slaves
had an hundred tables five times covered, they are gone home
and vanisht:
<T VERSE>Yet adde more honour to the Gentle Trade,
Taste of Eyres banquet, Simon's happie made.
<S KING.> Eyre, I wil taste of thy banquet, and wil say,
I have not met more pleasure on a day,
Friends of the Gentle Craft, thankes to you al,
Thankes my kind Ladie Mairesse for our cheere,
Come Lordes, a while lets revel it at home,
When all our sports, and banquetings are done,
Warres must right wrongs which Frenchmen have begun.

                                                       <T SDE>%Exeunt%.
