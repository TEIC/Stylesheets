        <p>This file is designed to fail validation in specific predicted ways.</p>

        <!--
            Test something from tagdocs that should *not* be valid, along
            with something that should.
        -->
        <p>Turns out, because of the use of
        <gi>elementRef</gi>s instead of just <tag>moduleRef
        key="tagdocs"</tag>, the <gi>gi</gi> elements in this
        paragraph should be valid, but the <gi>tag</gi>
        element should not.</p>

        <!-- 
             The testPure1 schema removed <join> and <joinGrp>, so the
             following should generate an error.
        -->
        <joinGrp type="invalid">
          <join result="p" scope="branches" target="#para1 #para2"/>
          <join result="p" scope="branches" target="#para3 #para4"/>
        </joinGrp>

        <p synch="#para1 #para2">The testPure1 schema has
        removed <att>synch</att> from att.global.linking, so
        its presence on this <gi>p</gi> should cause an
        error.</p>

          <label><att>corresp</att>: <gi>dataRef</gi> w/ <att>key</att></label>

          invalid, as <val>#para1</val> is not a teidata.count

          <item><measureGrp sameAs="1234"/> Should be invalid,
          as <val>1234</val> is a 4-digit teidata.count, not a
          1- or 2-digit teidata.count (i.e., non-negative
          integer). <note><emph>THIS TEST FAILS</emph> â€” it
          should be invalid, but is not flagged as such. Thus
          this test has correctly helped us find an error (or
          at least, a missing feature) in the Stylesheets. See
          <ref
              target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/349">#349</ref>;
          when it is fixed the expected-results of this file
          will need to be updated, and this entire
          <gi>note</gi> should be deleted.</note></item>

          <item><measureGrp copyOf="567.890"/> Should be
          invalid, as <val>567.890</val> is not an integer,
          let alone a 1- or 2-digit non-negative
          integer.</item>
