         <p>Kinde Gentlemen, and honest boone Companions, I present you<lb/>here with a merrie conceited Comedie, called, %the Shoemakers%<lb/>%Holyday%, acted by my Lorde Admiralls Players this present<lb/>Christmasse, before the Queenes most excellent Majestie. For the<lb/>mirth and plesant matter, by her Highnesse graciously accepted;<lb/>being indeed no way offensive. The Argument of the play I will<lb/>set downe in this Epistle: Sir %Hugh Lacie% Earle of %Lincolne%, had a<lb/>yong Gentleman of his owne name, his nere kinsman, that loved<lb/>the Lorde Maiors daughter of London; to prevent and crosse which<lb/>love, the Earle caused his kinsman to be sent Coronell of com-+<lb/>panie into France: who resigned his place to another gentleman his<lb/>friend, and came disguised like a Dutch Shoomaker, to the house<lb/>of %Symon Eyre% in Tower streete, who served the Maior and his<lb/>household with shooes. The merriments that passed in Eyres house, his<lb/>comming to be Maior of %London, Lacies% getting his love, and other<lb/>accidents; with two merry Three-mens songs. Take all in good<lb/>worth that is well intended, for nothing is purposed bu mirth,<lb/>mirht lengthneth long life; which, with all other blessings I heartily<lb/>wish you.<lb/>Farewell.<lb/>
